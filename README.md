# Financial Reporting Summarization

## Vision Statement
Financial professionals are faced with an overwhelming amount of financial literature that needs to be processed and analyzed to arrive at an investment thesis and recommendation, including determining the security to choose, at what price point to buy, the exit strategy, and where to buy in the capital structure. This requires reading through hundreds of pages of text, such as macroeconomic research papers, news, annual and quarterly reports, and earnings transcripts. Once a security is purchased, manual analysis of multi-page performance and risk reports must be conducted. To alleviate this burden, there is a growing interest in applying NLP algorithms to generate concise summaries that focus on specific decision-making information while leaving unnecessary verbiage to the side. This can be achieved by either finding labeled data, generating it through SMEs, or using data extraction methods combined with pre-set templates to generate financial summaries.

Our vision is to create a comprehensive financial reporting solution that caters to the needs of institutional investors, while also making algorithm-generated reports accessible to retail investors. We recognize the vast market potential for such a solution, and our goal is to level the playing field by providing timely and impactful financial information to all. In the US alone, there are an estimated 10,000 institutional investors, and with around 6,000 publicly listed companies, there is a demand for financial statement summaries that runs into the millions per year. With additional reports such as quarterly statements, the potential market size is even larger. Moreover, the retail market is also significant, with over 100 million user names at the six largest brokerages, and assuming an average of 20 companies per portfolio, the demand for financial reports is immense.

## Getting Started

This repository is organized into five main folders, each serving a specific purpose in the project:

- Data_source: This folder contains the data files used throughout the project. The original dataset consists of .htm files, while the .pkl files contain text information extracted from the original reports.

- Data_processing: This folder includes notebooks dedicated to processing the data source and performing text pre-processing tasks. These notebooks help clean and transform the data, preparing it for further analysis and model training.

- EDA: The EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) folder contains notebooks and other resources that provide insights into the data source. These files help visualize and understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, which in turn inform the model development process.

- Models: This folder comprises scripts and notebooks used for training, manipulating, and fine-tuning the models. It is the core component of the project, containing the algorithms and techniques employed to create the desired summaries and insights from the financial data.

- Final_output: The final output folder contains the results generated by the various models. These outputs represent the culmination of the data processing, EDA, and modeling efforts, showcasing the effectiveness of the project in achieving its goals.
