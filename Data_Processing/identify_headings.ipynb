primarily derived from cloud subscription fees that customers pay for supply chain solutions. since we announced our transition to becoming a cloud-first company in 2017 with our launch of manhattan active solutions, we have continued to see a significant shift in demand for cloud solutions versus software license. by comparison, in 2016, cloud subscriptions and software license revenue represented 7% and 93%, respectively, of our total cloud and software license revenue mix. in the full year ended 2020, cloud subscriptions and software license revenue were 68% and 32%, respectively, of our total cloud subscriptions and software license revenue mix. going forward, we expect cloud revenue to increase as a percentage of total software and cloud revenue mix as market demand for cloud

provides our customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which include additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. the growth of maintenance revenues is influenced by: (1) new software license revenue growth; (2) annual renewal of support contracts; (3) increase in customers through acquisitions; (4) fluctuations in currency rates, and (5) conversion of maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts. substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts. over the last three years, our annual revenue renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 90%. maintenance revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. maintenance renewal revenue is recognized over the renewal period once we have a contract upon payment from the customer.',\n","  'services revenue: in 2020, our services revenue totaled $303.6 million, or 52% of total revenue. the americas, emea, and apac segments recognized $232.9 million, $58.4 million, and $12.3 million, respectively. due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue, our consolidated operating margin profile may be lower than those of our competitors, and while we believe our services margins are strong, they do lower our operating margin profile as services margins are inherently lower than the margin for software license revenue and some of our other revenue

subscription revenue (recognized monthly) increases, which may make our results in any one period difficult to compare to any other period. for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,

decreases as a percentage of their overall spend with us. in addition, although we plan on increasing our professional services headcount in the long-term, we expect to shift an increasing percentage of implementation work to our network of third-party sis to better enable us to meet growing market demand. as a result, we expect our overall professional services revenue to increase in absolute dollars due to the growth in the number of our saas customers, but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue. for the fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our professional services revenue was $98.6

response to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of our employees. over a two-day period, we shifted 100% of our employee base to work from home and suspended international and domestic travel. this policy remained largely in place throughout fiscal year 2021, with only certain exceptions being made on a case-by-case basis. as a result, our travel-related expenses decreased from fiscal year 2020 to 2021.',\n","  'share-based compensation. in fiscal 2020, we had a high level of share-based compensation expense that was primarily driven by our ipo. for fiscal 2021, share-based compensation decreased due to the normalization of expense commensurate with employees continuing to vest in their awards over requisite service periods.',\n","  'non-gaap net income (loss). we define non-gaap net income as gaap net loss before amortization of share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets; and change in fair value of contingent earnout liability. we believe non-gaap net income provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. non-gaap net income was $10.7 million, $6.7 million, and $2.2 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. a reconciliation of non-gaap net income to net loss, the most directly

our saas net dollar retention rate was 120%, 117%, and 114% for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. our calculation excludes one existing contract for a service no longer offered on a standalone basis by the company. we believe saas net dollar retention rate is an important metric for the company because, in addition to providing a measure of retention, it indicates our ability to grow revenue within existing customer accounts. saas net dollar retention rate is included in a set of metrics that we calculate quarterly to review with management as well as periodically with

differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the u.s. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax

estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, and may include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment. we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as of october 1, 2020 and concluded that no impairment charge was

for new sales. our long-term relationships with existing customers provide us with significant opportunities to reach customer decision-makers and sell our product offerings that address the specific customer’s needs, allowing us to recognize incremental sales with lower sales and marketing spend than for a new customer. with the continued launch of new functionality for the duck creek suite, we have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full product portfolio and by encouraging existing term and perpetual license customers to adopt our saas solutions. as we demonstrate our value to customers, we believe we will have the opportunity to sell them additional solutions. moreover, because our products are priced on the basis of the amount of dwp generated by our customers, we expect our revenue will grow as our customers grow their businesses.',\n","  'timing of license revenue recognition and changing contract terms. because our offerings are typically priced based on a customer’s dwp, and our business relies on a relatively small number of high-value contracts, the license revenues recognized in any fiscal period in which we sign a term license with a large global carrier may be disproportionally higher than revenues recognized in a period in which we only sign term licenses with smaller carriers. we generally experience lengthy sales cycles because potential customers typically undertake a rigorous pre-purchase decision-making and evaluation process. additionally, our license revenue may significantly increase in any given period in which a new license contract is signed. in fiscal 2018, we revised our contracting practices and began to sell our term licenses with an initial two-year committed term and optional annual renewals instead of our historical three to six year committed terms. this contracting change has impacted historical period-over-period revenue comparisons. however, because of our revenue mix shift to subscription and since our contracts going forward are expected to have initial two-year committed terms, this change is not expected to have a material impact on the comparability of our results in future periods. our term license revenue accounted for 8%, 8%, and 13% of software revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.',\n","  'pursuing acquisitions. we have acquired and successfully integrated several businesses complementary to our own to enhance our software and technology capabilities. we intend to continue to pursue targeted acquisitions that further complement our product portfolio or provide us access to new markets. for example, in august 2016, we acquired agencyport software, a provider of intuitive, digital experiences between carriers and their agents, brokers, consumers and policyholders; in january 2017, we acquired yodil, llc, a pioneer in insurance data management solutions; in october 2018, we acquired outline systems llc, a provider of p&c distribution channel management software and longstanding member of our partner ecosystem; and in june 2019, we acquired the cederight products business, a provider of reinsurance management software, from datacede llc. as a result of the contributions of these businesses and any future businesses we may acquire, our results of operations may not be comparable between periods. for fiscal 2021 and 2020, we did not engage in any acquisition activity. in fiscal 2019 cash consideration for acquisitions was $11.6 million.',\n","  'long-term customer financing: we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. we generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. we generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. we financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and $1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.',\n","  'strategic acquisitions',\n","  'business combinations, including intangible assets, contingent consideration, and goodwill',\n","  'plan of operation',\n","  'net retention rate',\n","  'total customers. we believe that our ability to increase our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and growth of our business as we continue to expand our sales force and invest in marketing efforts. we define our total customers at the end of a particular period as the number of business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions to our crm platform either paid directly or through a solutions partner. we do not include in total customers business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions solely for our legacy sales hub ($10) product or any piesync product. a single customer may have separate paid subscriptions for separate websites, sales licenses or seats, or our sales hub, marketing hub, service hub, or cms hub products, but we count these as one customer if certain customer-provided information such as company name, url, or email address indicate that these subscriptions are managed by the same business entity or individual.',\n","  'total average subscription revenue per customer. we believe that our ability to increase the total average subscription revenue per customer is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our existing customer relationships. we define total average subscription revenue per customer during a particular period as subscription revenue, excluding revenue from our legacy sales hub ($10) and piesync products, from our total customers during the period divided by the average total customers during the same period.',\n","  'total subscription dollar retention rate. we believe that our ability to retain and expand a customer relationship is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customers. we assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our total subscription dollar retention rate. we compare the aggregate total contractual monthly subscription revenue of our total customer base as of the beginning of each month, which we refer to as total retention base revenue, to the aggregate total contractual monthly subscription revenue of the same group of total customers at the end of that month, which we refer to as total retained subscription revenue. we define total contractual monthly subscription revenue as the total amount of subscription fees contractually committed to be paid for a full month under all of our total customer agreements, excluding any commissions owed to our solutions partners. our total subscription dollar retention rate for a given period is calculated by first dividing total retained subscription revenue by total retention base revenue for each month in the period, calculating the weighted average of these rates using the total retention base revenue for each month in the period, and then annualizing the resulting rates.',\n","  'market adoption of our platform. our long-term success will depend on widespread adoption of connected planning by enterprises for numerous planning applications with broad use of those applications within their organizations. while we believe that we are still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable market, we have benefited from rapid customer growth.',\n","  'customer first strategy. we put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. we view our customer first strategy as core to capturing our connected planning vision and driving the continued adoption and expansion in the use of our platform. by aligning our thought leadership, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our customer first strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers’ connected planning and digital transformation journeys. our continued success depends in part on our ability to continue to put customers at the center of our strategy.',\n","  'expansion of existing customers. we employ a “land and expand” approach, with many of our customers initially deploying our product for a specific use case and group of users. once they realize the benefits and wide applicability of our platform, many of our customers subsequently renew their subscriptions and expand the number of users or use cases within and across lines of business and geographies as they continue unlocking the agile enterprise planning and operating model across functional boundaries. as a result, we are able to generate a significant increase in revenue from the expanded use of our platform across the enterprise. going forward, we are focused on targeting customers where the opportunity for expansion and need for our planning solutions are greatest. our future revenue growth and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to maintain existing customer relationships and to continue to expand our customers’ use of our platform.',\n","  'scaling our sales team. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership and sales efforts, both domestically and internationally. we have invested and intend to continue to invest in expanding and retaining our sales leadership and direct sales force, particularly in attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience selling to larger enterprises. our ability to increase our revenue will depend on the new members of our sales force becoming fully productive and executing expeditiously and effective sales leadership. a customer’s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision. these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our platform, which involves substantial time, effort, and costs.',\n","  'international sales. our total revenue generated outside of the united states during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, was approximately 46%, 43% and 43%, respectively, of our total revenue. we believe global demand for our platform will continue to develop as organizations experience the benefits that our platform can provide to international enterprises with complex planning needs spanning multiple geographies. accordingly, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. we have invested, and plan to invest, ahead of this potential demand in personnel, marketing, and access to data center capacity to support our international growth.',\n","  'partner ecosystem. our partner ecosystem extends our geographic coverage, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, and enables more efficient delivery of service solutions. we intend to augment and deepen our partnerships with strategic and advisory consulting, systems integration, public cloud, and technology firms. we believe our partners’ scale and route to market can significantly contribute to our ability to penetrate our addressable market, extend our geographic coverage, and extend usage and adoption of our platform.',\n","  'partner ecosystem.',\n","  'product velocity. we have invested and intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development in an effort to enhance and expand the functionality of our platform, to attract and retain development personnel, and to protect our market-leading technology advantage. we have a well-defined technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to our platform that we believe will improve our ability to generate revenue by broadening the appeal of our platform to potential new customers as well as increasing the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers. we are also investing to further enhance the functionality, intelligence, user experience,

software licenses with support and/or cloud services over the same term. on-premises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support and/or cloud components. on-premises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer, while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized over the term of the contract. in cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and on-premises software, an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the on-premises software. in the substantial majority of instances, cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the on-premises software. this assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve.',\n","  'allocation of transaction price. we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the on-premises license, support, and cloud components of our subscription products. these estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses and support and/or cloud.',\n","  'right to exchange. our multi-year, non-cancellable on-premises subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. we account for this right as a refund liability. for most contracts, we use the expected value method to determine the refund liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts. where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the refund liability for each individual contract. in both circumstances, the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates, which impacts the amount of revenue recognized. changes in these

of maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts. substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts. over the last three years, our annual revenue renewal rate of

totaled $303.6 million, or 52% of total revenue. the americas, emea, and apac segments recognized $232.9 million, $58.4 million, and $12.3 million, respectively. due to our large services revenue mix

strategy is to continue to grow our subscription revenue by signing new saas customers and increasing sales to our existing saas customers. additionally, over time we also expect to migrate existing term and perpetual license customers to our saas solutions. as a result, our software revenue mix will continue to change over time as the portion of license revenue (primarily recognized up-front) decreases and the portion of subscription revenue (recognized monthly) increases, which may make our results in any one period difficult to compare to any other period. for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, subscription revenue was 77%, 71% and 60% of software revenue, respectively.', 'continued and increased adoption of our solutions by customers. strong customer relationships are a key driver of our success given the importance of customer references for new sales. our long-term relationships with existing customers provide us with significant opportunities to reach customer decision-makers and sell our product offerings that address the specific customer’s needs, allowing us to recognize incremental sales with lower sales and marketing spend than for a new customer. with the continued launch of new functionality for the duck creek suite, we have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full product portfolio and by encouraging existing term and perpetual license customers to adopt our saas solutions. as we demonstrate our value to customers, we believe we will have the opportunity to sell them additional solutions. moreover, because our products are priced on the basis of the amount of dwp generated by our customers, we expect our revenue will grow as our customers grow their businesses.', 'timing of license revenue recognition and changing contract terms. because our offerings are typically priced based on a customer’s dwp, and our business relies on a relatively small number of high-value contracts, the license revenues recognized in any fiscal period in which we sign a term license with a large global carrier may be disproportionally higher than revenues recognized in a period in which we only sign term licenses with smaller carriers. we generally experience lengthy sales cycles because potential customers typically undertake a rigorous pre-purchase decision-making and evaluation process. additionally, our license revenue may significantly increase in any given period in which a new license contract is signed. in fiscal 2018, we revised our contracting practices and began to sell our term licenses with an initial two-year committed term and optional annual renewals instead of our historical three to six year committed terms. this contracting change has impacted historical period-over-period revenue comparisons. however, because of our revenue mix shift to subscription and since our contracts going forward are expected to have initial two-year committed terms, this change is not expected to have a material impact on the comparability of our results in future periods. our term license revenue accounted for 8%, 8%, and 13% of software revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.', 'timing of license revenue recognition and changing contract terms', 'investment in sales and marketing organization. we plan to continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to grow our customer base, increase sales of additional functionality to existing customers and encourage carriers who currently operate legacy systems or use one or more of our competitor’s applications to adopt our saas solutions. we expect to add sales personnel and expand our marketing activities. we also intend to continue to expand our international sales and marketing organization, which we believe will be an important factor in our continued growth. our sales and marketing expenses totaled $54.1 million, $50.3 million, and $40.2 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.', 'investment in saas operations. we will continue to invest in duck creek ondemand, including through our new saas operations center and continued growth in the number of our cloud and saas operations experts, to further our goal of delivering the best experience for our saas customers. personnel related costs of our saas operations team is the fastest growing component of our cost of subscription revenue. our cost of subscription revenue totaled $47.3 million, $34.9 million, and $24.2 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.', 'investment in technology and research and development efforts. we are committed to continuing to deliver market-leading software to carriers and believe that maintaining our product leadership is critical to driving further revenue growth. as a result, we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts to extend the functionality and breadth of our current solutions as well as develop and launch new products and tools to address the evolving needs of the p&c insurance industry. our research and development expenses totaled $48.5 million, $44.1 million, and $35.9 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.', 'pursuing acquisitions. we have acquired and successfully integrated several businesses complementary to our own to enhance our software and technology capabilities. we intend to continue to pursue targeted acquisitions that further complement our product portfolio or provide us access to new markets. for example, in august 2016, we acquired agencyport software, a provider of intuitive, digital experiences between carriers and their agents, brokers, consumers and policyholders; in january 2017, we acquired yodil, llc, a pioneer in insurance data management solutions; in october 2018, we acquired outline systems llc, a provider of p&c distribution channel management software and longstanding member of our partner ecosystem; and in june 2019, we acquired the cederight products business, a provider of reinsurance management software, from datacede llc. as a result of the contributions of these businesses and any future businesses we may acquire, our results of operations may not be comparable between periods. for fiscal 2021 and 2020, we did not engage in any acquisition activity. in fiscal 2019 cash consideration for acquisitions was $11.6 million.', 'mix of professional services revenue. our professional services teams ensure the successful configuration and integration of our solutions, and provide continuous support to our customers. we recognize most of our professional services revenue during initial deployment, and recognize additional revenue for services provided over the lifetime of a customer’s use of our software. over time, a customer’s spend on professional services decreases as a percentage of their overall spend with us. in addition, although we plan on increasing our professional services headcount in the long-term, we expect to shift an increasing percentage of implementation work to our network of third-party sis to better enable us to meet growing market demand. as a result, we expect our overall professional services revenue to increase in absolute dollars due to the growth in the number of our saas customers, but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue. for the fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our professional services revenue was $98.6 million, or 38% of total revenue, $94.1 million, 44% of total revenue, and $77.7 million, 45% of total revenue respectively.', 'mix of professional services revenue', 'covid-19 expenses. in march 2020, we implemented various measures in response to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of our employees. over a two-day period, we shifted 100% of our employee base to work from home and suspended international and domestic travel. this policy remained largely in place throughout fiscal year 2021, with only certain exceptions being made on a case-by-case basis. as a result, our travel-related expenses decreased from fiscal year 2020 to 2021.', 'share-based compensation. in fiscal 2020, we had a high level of share-based compensation expense that was primarily driven by our ipo. for fiscal 2021, share-based compensation decreased due to the normalization

cost of capital. the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these

bundle of products and services, typically pairing on-premises term software licenses with support and/or cloud services over the same term. on-premises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support and/or cloud components. on-premises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer, while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized over the term of the contract. in cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and on-premises software, an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the on-premises software. in the substantial majority of instances, cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the on-premises software. this assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve.', 'allocation of transaction price. we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the on-premises license, support, and cloud components of our subscription products. these estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses and support and/or cloud.', 'right to exchange. our multi-year, non-cancellable on-premises subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. we account for this right as a refund liability. for most contracts, we use the expected value method to determine the refund liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts. where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the refund liability for each individual contract. in both circumstances, the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates, which impacts the amount of revenue recognized. changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period.', 'valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations', 'cash,
