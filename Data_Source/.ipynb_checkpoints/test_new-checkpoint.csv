823546,"Overview Our Corporate History On June 27, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), RocketFuel Blockchain Company (“RBC”) and B4MC Gold Mines, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“B4MC” or the “Purchaser”), consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) made and entered into as of June 27, 2018 by and among RBC, the Purchaser and Gert Funk, Joseph Page, PacificWave Partners Limited, PacificWave Partners UK Ltd. and Saxton Capital Ltd (collectively referred to herein as the “Sellers”, individually each a “Seller”). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement the Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned and conveyed to B4MC all right, title and interest in and to one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of RBC for an aggregate of 17,001,312 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of B4MC (the “Purchaser Common Stock”), (such transaction, the “Business Combination”). As a result of the Business Combination, RBC became a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of B4MC. In September 2018 B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. References to “we” and similar terms in this report are to B4MC after the consummation of the Business Transaction. Prior to the Business Combination, B4MC was a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the Business Combination, we have ceased to be a “shell company.” The Business Combination was treated as a “reverse acquisition” of RBC for financial accounting purposes. RBC was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements of BFMC before the Business Combination were replaced with the historical financial statements of RBC before the Business Combination in all future filings with the SEC. The Purchaser Common Stock issued to the Sellers in connection with the Business Combination have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2), which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under that section. These shares may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. In this report, references to RocketFuel, the “Company,” “we” and similar terms are to B4MC following the consummation of the reverse acquisition. In September 2018 B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. The foregoing description of the Contribution Agreement does not purport to be complete. For further information, please refer to the copy of the Contribution Agreement included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed with the SEC on June 29, 2018. There are representations and warranties contained in the Contribution Agreement that were made by the parties to each other as of the date of execution. The assertions embodied in these representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Contribution Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating their terms. Moreover, some representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from certain standards generally applicable to shareholders or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. For these reasons, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Contribution Agreement as statements of factual information. Our Business We provide check-out and payment systems that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. Our check-out systems are designed to enhance customers’ data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, our check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant. They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page. Our merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the different currencies received by the merchant as payment. In addition to various metrics, merchants are able to see a variety of reports, and are able to configure various options including settlement options from their portal. Customers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are currently able to connect to their accounts on Coinbase, and in the future we plan to add connectivity to Binance, Kraken, Gemini and other exchanges to pay directly from bank accounts. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to pay from as well. These customers are able to make payment with any of these payment options with 1, 2, or 3 clicks from the merchant checkout page. By default, these customers can choose from dozens of cryptocurrencies to pay from. Our payment user interface allows customers to easily onboard as well as to pay for merchants’ products or services with a variety of cryptocurrencies or via bank transfers. The user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The browser extension is integrated with popular browsers including Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Firefox, and Edge. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms. The RocketFuel payment solution utilizes a variety of blockchains in its execution including Bitcoin, Ethereum and others where the payment transactions are stored. A significant benefit of this technology is that the entire shopping cart checkout process will be accomplished via a distributed ledger or “blockchain,” meaning that merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex payment and check-out infrastructures. Our solution is designed to be implemented on an eCommerce site’s check-out page. The technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, we anticipate that a future version of our payment system will allow for advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded on third party websites where sales may be completely finalized. Thus, our technology could enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. We believe that this has never before been accomplished in any eCommerce arrangement. We believe that such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions. We also believe that transactions costs on our system will be significantly less expensive than the cost of credit-card transactions. The “single-click” RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined one- to-three-click check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The system is designed to operate identically across merchant channels with all participating merchants. eCommerce merchants are able to encode their check-out protocol to support our technology and the merchants will no longer have to administer complex check-out and payment gateways at their eCommerce websites. At the same time, consumers are able to experience enhanced data protection opportunities and significantly improved convenience. With the RocketFuel check-out systems, consumers will no longer have to enter credit card information or shipping details every time they want to buy online. Payment and shipping information will be handled automatically. Using the RocketFuel payment solution, credit card data will no longer be shared or transmitted and exposed online. Rather, payments will be made via 100% secure cryptocurrency conveyance or direct bank transfer on the blockchain. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 to our financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our financial statements. In applying these policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of market trends, information provided by our strategic partners and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our financial statements. Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2021 vs. March 31, 2020 Revenues During the three month period ended March 31, 2021, we commenced commercial operations and executed a contract with one customer having a one-year term from the date of execution (the “Contract Term”), which was March 31, 2021, that provided for the payment of $10,000 in connection with the implementation of our blockchain technology. In addition, the Contract Term provided for transaction processing using our blockchain technology with no fees during the Contract Term as an inducement to adopt our blockchain technology. We recorded the $10,000 fee as deferred revenue which will be amortized ratably over the Contract Term. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we did not generate any revenue and had not yet commenced commercial operations. We anticipate that future revenues will be generated from (i) fees charged in connection with the implementation of our blockchain technology; and (ii) ongoing daily transactional fees derived as a negotiated percentage of the transactional revenues earned by our merchant customers. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were $163,405 as compared to $3,390 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $160,015. The increase is primarily a result of the engagement of contract developers and the payroll expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of our full-time chief technology officer, all of whom were engaged in continued development of our blockchain technology for payment processing. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were $2,200,177 as compared to $121,649 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $2,078,528. The increase is primarily a result of (i) legal fees incurred in connection with certain litigation costs and payroll expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of our full-time chief executive officer, and (ii) stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 of $1,622,335 was composed of (i) the $162,000 value of 150,000 shares of our common stock issued to an independent consultant for services in lieu of cash consideration; (ii) stock options granted to employees which were valued at $1,090,204; (iii) the issuance of a warrant to our chief executive officer that is exercisable into 265,982 shares of our common stock and valued at $370,131; and the (iv) repricing of certain stock options granted to our chief financial officer in August 2018 which were re-priced resulting in additional stock-based compensation of $489,064. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2021, we had cash of $800,331, an increase of $792,493 as compared to a cash balance of $7,838 as of March 31, 2020. Our current cash requirements are approximately $200,000 per month. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, net cash of $636,257 was used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily composed of our net loss of $2,363,582 and offset by (i) $1,460,335 of non-cash stock-based compensation in connection with the grant of employee stock options and issuance of a common stock purchase warrant to our chief executive officer; (ii) $162,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation in connection with the issuance of 150,000 shares of our common stock to a consultant for services in lieu of cash consideration; and (iii) increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and related party payable of $109,990 in the aggregate. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, net cash of $1,428,750 was provided by financing activities from the issuance of 1,478,750 shares of our common stock to two investors. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, net cash of $121,250 was provided by financing activities from the issuance of 121,250 shares of our common stock in consideration of $121,250 in gross cash proceeds. There were no options exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and no options or warrants exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, one investor exercised warrants to purchase 1,100,000 shares of our common stock of which (i) 1,000,000 shares of our common stock were issued in consideration of gross proceeds of $1,000,000 prior to March 31, 2021; and (ii) 100,000 shares of our common stock, for which we received notice of exercise on March 31, 2021, were issued subsequent to March 31, 2021 in consideration of gross proceeds of $100,000. Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we reported a net loss of $2,363,582, which included non-cash stock-based compensation of $1,622,335, and cash flows used in operating activities of $636,257. As a result, management believes that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will require additional financing in order to continue to develop our product and execute on our business plan. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the additional capital necessary to continue operations and execute on our business plan. Any potential future sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are required to raise additional financing, but are unable to obtain such financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our operations or business development activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.",
1580808,"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations (“MD&amp;A”) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. In addition to historical information, the MD&amp;A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those matters discussed under the heading “Forward-looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward‑looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K and elsewhere in this document. Overview We are a leading provider of networking solutions that enable next-generation networks focused on reliability, availability, scalability and cybersecurity. Our portfolio supports customers operating in the cloud, on-premise or in hybrid environments providing rapid return on their investment as well as investment protection with best-in-class technical performance. As cyber-attacks increase in volume and complexity, we integrate security as a key attribute in our solutions that further enable our customers to continue to adapt to market trends in cloud, internet of things and the ever increasing need for more data, building upon our strong global footprint and leadership in application and network infrastructure. Our customers include leading service providers (cloud, telecommunications, multiple system operators, cable), government organizations, and enterprises. Our product portfolio seeks to address many of the cyber protection challenges and solution requirements. The portfolio consists of six secure application solutions; Thunder Application Delivery Controller (“ADC”), Lightning Application Delivery Controller (“Lightning ADC”), Thunder Carrier Grade Networking (“CGN”), Thunder Threat Protection System (“TPS”), Thunder SSL Insight (“SSLi”) and Thunder Convergent Firewall (“CFW”) and intelligent management, and automation tools; Harmony Controller and aGalaxy TPS. Our products are offered in a variety of form factors and payment models, including physical appliances and perpetual and subscription-based software licenses, as well as pay-as-you-go licensing models and FlexPool, a flexible consumption-based software model. We derive revenue from sales of products and related support services. Products revenue is generated primarily by sales of hardware appliances with perpetual licenses to our embedded software solutions. We also derive revenue from licenses to, or subscription services for, software-only versions of our solutions. We generate services revenue primarily from sales of maintenance and support contracts. Our customers predominantly purchase maintenance and support in conjunction with purchases of our products. In addition, we also derive revenue from the sale of professional services. We sell our products globally to service providers and enterprises that depend on data center applications and networks to generate revenue and manage operations efficiently. In 2019, we changed the way we present revenue by customer vertical. We now report two customer verticals: service providers and enterprises, compared to service providers, enterprises and web giants in prior years. Our previously reported revenue from web giants is primarily accounted for now in enterprise revenue. Additionally, we changed the way we present customer revenue by geographic region. We now report customer revenues in four geographic regions: the Americas, Japan, Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) and EMEA. Our previously reported customer revenues of our United States and Latin America regions are now included in the Americas geographic region. We believe this new geographic and vertical view aligns with how we manage the business and maps our product portfolio to customer verticals. The revenue by vertical percentages from prior years included in this report have been revised to conform with current year presentation. Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, technology, industrial, retail, financial, gaming, education and government. Since inception, our customer base has grown rapidly. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold products to more than 7,290 end-customers worldwide. We sell substantially all of our solutions through our high-touch sales organization as well as distribution channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers and system integrators, and fulfill nearly all orders globally through such partners. We believe this sales approach allows us to obtain the benefits of channel distribution, such as expanding our market coverage, while still maintaining face-to-face relationships with our end-customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. We perform quality assurance and testing at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers’ locations. During 2020, 43% of our total revenue was generated from the Americas, 30% from Japan and 27% from other geographical regions. During 2019, 42% of our total revenue was generated from the Americas, 28% from Japan and 30% from 49 other geographical regions. During 2018, 48% of our total revenue was generated from the Americas, 24% from Japan and 28% from other geographical regions. Our enterprise customers accounted for 39%, 42% and 43% of our total revenue during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our service provider customers accounted for 61%, 58% and 57% of our total revenue during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of the nature of our target market and the current stage of our development, a substantial portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of large customers and service providers, in any period. Purchases from our ten largest end-customers accounted for 41%, 36% and 37% of our total revenue for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales to these large end-customers have typically been characterized by large but irregular purchases with long sales cycles. The timing of these purchases and the delivery of the purchased products are difficult to predict. Consequently, any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases by or deliveries to our largest customers could materially impact our revenue and operating results in any quarterly period. This may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and make them difficult to predict. As of December 31, 2020, we had $83.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $74.9 million of marketable securities. Cash provided by operating activities was $55.3 million in 2020 compared to $0.4 million of cash used in operating activities in 2019. We intend to continue to invest for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in our product development efforts to deliver new products and additional features in our current products to address customer needs. In addition, we may expand our global sales and marketing organizations, expand our distribution channel partner programs and increase awareness of our solutions on a global basis. Our investments in growth in these areas may affect our short-term profitability. 50 Results of Operations A summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (dollars in thousands): 51 Revenue Our products revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances upon which our software is installed. Such software includes our ACOS software platform plus one or more of our ADC, CGN, TPS, SSLi or CFW solutions. Purchase of a hardware appliance includes a perpetual license to the included software. We recognize products revenue upon transfer of control, generally at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of revenue, our products revenue may vary from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the timing of orders and delivery of products, cyclicality and seasonality, changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions. We generate services revenue from sales of post contract support (“PCS”), which is bundled with sales of products and professional services. We offer tiered PCS services under renewable, fee-based PCS contracts, primarily including technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, and software upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize services revenue ratably over the term of the PCS contract, which is typically one year, but can be up to seven years. Our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in January 2018 resulted in a $2.6 million increase in products revenue in 2018. See Note 2 Revenue, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 52 A summary of our total revenue is as follows (dollars in thousands): 2020 Revenue Compared to 2019 Revenue Total revenue increased by $12.9 million, or 6%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was due to a $8.0 million increase in products revenue and a $4.9 million increase in services revenue. Products revenue increased $8.0 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by higher demand from our service provider and enterprise customers in the Americas, and from higher demand from service provider customers in Japan. Services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base in Japan. During 2020, $98.2 million, or 43% of total revenue, was generated from the Americas, which represents a 9% increase compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher products revenue driven by an increase in demand from our service provider customers. 53 During 2020, $67.1 million, or 30% of total revenue, was generated from Japan, which represents a 13% increase compared to 2019. The increase was mainly due to increased revenue from our service provider customers. During 2020, $29.8 million, or 13% of total revenue, was generated from the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan, which represents a 17% decrease compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by lower revenues from our service provider and enterprise customers. During 2020, $30.6 million, or 14% of total revenue, was generated from EMEA, which represented an 11% increase compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher products revenue driven by an increase in demand from our enterprise customers. 2019 Revenue Compared to 2018 Revenue Total revenue decreased by $19.6 million, or 8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was due to a $22.8 million decrease in products revenue, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in services revenue. The decrease in products revenue was primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider and enterprise customers in the Americas, partially offset by an increase in product revenues in Japan. Products revenue decreased $22.8 million, or 16%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower demand from our service provider and enterprise customers in the Americas, partially offset by increased revenues in Japan. Services revenue increased $3.2 million, or 4%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increases were primarily attributable to the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base. During 2019, $89.9 million, or 42% of total revenue, was generated from the Americas, which represents a 20% decrease compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower product revenue driven by lower demand from our service provider and enterprise customers in the Americas. During 2019, $59.5 million, or 28% of total revenue, was generated from Japan, which represents a 8% increase compared to 2018. The increase was mainly due to increased revenue from our enterprise customers in Japan. During 2019, $35.7 million, or 17% of total revenue, was generated from the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan, which represents a 3% decrease compared to 2018. The decrease was driven primarily by lower revenues from our enterprise customers in Asia Pacific. During 2019, $27.5 million, or 13% of total revenue, was generated from EMEA, which remained relatively constant compared to 2018. Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Cost of Revenue Cost of products revenue is primarily comprised of cost of third-party manufacturing services and cost of inventory for the hardware component of our products. Cost of products revenue also includes warehouse personnel costs, shipping costs, inventory write-downs, certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, and expenses associated with logistics and quality control. Cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs for our technical support, training and professional service teams. Cost of services revenue also includes the costs of inventory used to provide hardware replacements to end- customers under PCS contracts and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. 54 A summary of our cost of revenue is as follows (dollars in thousands): Gross Margin Gross margin may vary and be unpredictable from period to period due to a variety of factors. These may include the mix of revenue from each of our regions, the mix of our products sold within a period, discounts provided to customers, inventory write-downs and foreign currency exchange rates. Our sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, however, in Japan they are denominated in Japanese yen. Any of the factors noted above can generate either a favorable or unfavorable impact on gross margin. A summary of our gross profit and gross margin is as follows (dollars in thousands): 2020 Gross Margin Compared to 2019 Gross Margin Products gross margin increased by 2.1% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by changes in product and geographic mix. 55 Services gross margin decreased by 1.0% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher personnel related support costs. 2019 Gross Margin Compared to 2018 Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased by 1.0% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by changes in product and geographic mix. Services gross margin decreased by 0.6% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher personnel related support costs. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and restructuring expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs which consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation. A summary of our operating expenses is as follows (dollars in thousands): Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses are our largest functional category of operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include the cost of marketing programs, trade shows, consulting services, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, we expensed sales commissions associated with the acquisition of customer contracts as incurred in the period the contract was acquired. Upon the adoption of ASC 606 in January 2018, $8.4 million of our sales commission expenses from prior periods has been deferred and will be recognized over an expected benefit 56 period as required by ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers . See Note 2 Revenue, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The $15.1 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a 12% decrease in headcount, resulting in a $9.6 million decrease in salary and benefit expenses, a $4.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment and a $1.1 million decrease in marketing expenses. The $10.4 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a 14% decrease in headcount, resulting in a $7.0 million decrease in salary and benefit expenses, a $0.9 million decrease in travel and entertainment and $0.8 million decrease in depreciation. In 2021, we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain at 2020 levels as we continue to actively control costs. Research and Development Research and development efforts are focused on new product development and on developing additional functionality for our existing products. These expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, and, to a lesser extent, prototype materials, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred. The $3.8 million decrease in research and development expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit expenses, partially offset by an increase in facility expense. The $3.3 million decrease in research and development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit expenses. In 2021, we expect research and development expenses to remain at 2020 levels as we continue to actively control costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, professional services and office expenses. General and administrative personnel costs include executive, finance, human resources, information technology, facility and legal related expenses. Professional services primarily consist of fees for outside accounting, tax, legal, recruiting and other administrative services. The $1.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and contractor fees, partially offset by an increase in business operations and facility expenses. The $15.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to $10.1 million lower legal fees, $1.4 million lower audit-related costs, $1.7 million lower contractor and consultant expense (all related to the 2018 litigation settlement, investigation and restatement efforts), $1.0 million lower commission and bonus, $2.3 million reduction in general IT expenses and $0.4 million lower recruiting costs. In 2021, we expect general and administrative expenses to remain at 2020 levels as we continue to actively control costs. Restructuring Expense In October 2019, we began implementing a restructuring plan in our ongoing efforts to reduce operating costs and focus on advanced technologies. The restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 5% of our workforce and the closure and consolidation of certain U.S. and international office facilities. The restructuring was completed by the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2020. We recorded restructuring expenses of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, which included the following (in thousands): 57 Interest Expense In the past, interest expense has primarily consisted of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs. We elected to allow our credit facility to expire in November 2019 without renewal. Should we seek additional sources of funding we may incur increased interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense was immaterial in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Interest and other income, net, had a favorable change of $0.5 million, or 53%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a $1.4 million increase in foreign exchange gain, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in interest income. Interest and other income, net, had an unfavorable change of $0.4 million, or 28%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by a $0.7 million increase in foreign exchange loss, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in interest income. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily consisted of foreign income taxes. We currently maintain a valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets, and we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance. See Note 11 Income Taxes, of the note to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the Company’s taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $83.3 million, including $5.4 million held outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, and $74.9 million of marketable securities. We currently do not have any plans to repatriate our earnings from our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $134.5 million, accumulated deficit of $272.2 million and total stockholders’ equity of $116.0 million. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth, and our investment may increase. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced 58 product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. On May 17, 2020, we entered into a Common Stock Repurchase and Option Exchange Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with Lee Chen, the Company’s founder and its former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock from Mr. Chen for approximately $13.3 million. The common shares repurchased are held in treasury and accounted for under the cost method. On September 17, 2020, we issued a press release announcing that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million of its common stock over a period of twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares for a total cost of $19.2 million under this program and as of December 31, 2020 we had $30.8 million available to repurchase shares. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. To date, all repurchases under this program have occurred in the open market. In addition, as described in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be currently, or may be from time to time, involved in ongoing litigation. Any adverse settlements or judgments in any litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur. Statements of Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands): Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by sales of our products and management of working capital investments. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $55.3 million, consisting of net income of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $24.7 million and a favorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $12.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $11.3 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects cash inflows from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.5 million, accrued liabilities and other of $3.9 million, accounts receivable of $2.3 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.1 million, partially offset by cash outflows from changes in accounts payable of $2.7 million. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments to our vendors. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million, consisting of net loss of $17.8 million, non-cash charges of $26.2 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $16.5 million and depreciation and 59 amortization expenses of $10.0 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an outflow from the changes in accrued liabilities and other of $5.9 million and inventory of $5.6 million, partially offset by an inflow from changes in deferred revenue of $3.2 million. The unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and other was driven by an increase in lease liabilities associated with the lease of the San Jose corporate office. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to build up of inventory and timing of shipments, partially offset by increased reserves. The favorable change in deferred revenues was primarily driven by increased bookings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million, consisting of net loss of $27.6 million which includes payments for our internal investigation costs of $8.6 million, non-cash charges of $25.0 million and an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.1 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of $7.9 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects an inflow from the changes in deferred revenue of $7.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $3.1 million, offset primarily by an outflow from the changes in accounts receivable of $6.1 million, prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million and inventory of $1.5 million. The favorable change in deferred revenue was primarily driven by the increase in the sale of subscription and support. The favorable change in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to higher accrued bonuses and commissions, increased value added tax accrual due to timing of payments, and an increase in legal fees accrual. The unfavorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other assets was mainly driven by the increase in deferred sales commissions due to higher deferred revenue and higher average commission rate. The unfavorable change in inventory was due to the timing of shipments. Cash Flows from Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by investing activities was $5.2 million, consisting of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $66.8 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $58.0 million and property and equipment of $3.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 million, marketable securities of $71.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $75.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $6.9 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $2.8 million, marketable securities of $86.8 million and investment of $1.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $83.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in financing activities was $22.9 million consisting primarily of $32.5 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by $9.6 million of cash proceeds from common stock issuances under our equity incentive plans. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $5.8 million consisting primarily of proceeds from common stock issuances under our equity incentive plans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in financing activities was $3.6 million consisting primarily of proceeds from common stock issuances under our equity incentive plans. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of operating leases. 60 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): The contractual obligations table above excludes $4.6 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and related component parts and is stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate inventory for excess and obsolete products, based on management’s assessment of future demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs, once established, are not reversed as they establish a new cost basis for the inventory. Inventory write downs are included as a component of cost of products revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and subscription revenue; and (ii) services revenue, which includes post contract support (“PCS”), professional services, and training. A substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of our products and services through distribution channel partners, such as resellers and distributors. Revenue is recognized, net of applicable taxes, upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model: • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract • Determination of the transaction price • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract • Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied. PCS revenue includes arrangements for software support and technical support for our products. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches, and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. Revenue for PCS services is recognized on a straight-line basis over 61 the service contract term, which is typically one year, but can be up to five years as there is no discernible pattern of transfer related to these promises. Billed but unearned PCS revenue is included in deferred revenue. Professional service revenue primarily consists of the fees we earn related to installation and consulting services. We recognize revenue from professional services upon delivery or completion of performance. Professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within 30 to 90 days from the start of service. Revenue is recognized for training when the training course is delivered. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Most of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes embedded ACOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS. If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end-customer. We account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate. Our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts. However, we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration. We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to recent accounting pronouncements. 62",
1576914,"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results may vary materially from those indicated as a result of the risks that affect our business, including, among others, those identified in “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. Overview We are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers’ vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations. We were founded in 1996 and we have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet partners worldwide. MiX Telematics shares are publicly traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: MIX) and MiX Telematics American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MIXT). We derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our fleet and mobile asset management solutions. Our subscriptions generally include access to our SaaS solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, use of an in-vehicle device. We also generate revenues from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which enable customers to use our subscription-based solutions, installation services of our in-vehicle-devices and driver training for fleet customers. We generate sales through the efforts of our direct sales teams, staffed in our regional sales offices, and through our global network of distributors and dealers. Our direct sales teams focus on marketing our fleet solutions to global and multinational enterprise accounts and to other large customer accounts located in regions of the world where we maintain a direct sales presence. Our direct sales teams have industry expertise across multiple industries, including oil and gas, transportation and logistics, government and municipal, bus and coach, rental and leasing, and utilities. In some markets, we rely on a network of distributors and dealers to sell our solutions on our behalf. Our distributors and dealers also install our in-vehicle devices and provide training, technical support and ongoing maintenance for the customers they support. Impact of COVID-19 In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China (“COVID-19”). In January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern and, subsequently, it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The outbreak continued to spread globally, affecting global economic activity and financial markets. We have considered the impact of COVID-19 including its impact on expected credit losses and potential goodwill impairments, however numerous uncertainties remain, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact on our customers and other factors identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors - The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. ” in this Form 10-K. Business, employees and operations Due to extensive measures implemented by various governments, all of our employees were required to work remotely, with the exception of our staff working in our monitoring centers, which were classified as an essential service. We have implemented appropriate safeguards for these centers. In addition, we have modified certain business and 53 workforce practices (including extended work from home requirements, suspension of certain business travel and cancellation of certain physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we implemented various cost-saving measures, including headcount reductions, deferred salary increases, a hiring freeze across the business, and significant reductions in discretionary spending. We started to realize the benefit of these actions in the second quarter. As part of the headcount reductions in fiscal 2021, we incurred a $1.1 million re structuring charge as we committed to plans to restructure certain parts of our business as a measure to minimize the adverse economic and business effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and to re-align resources to our current business outlook and cost structure. The restructuring activities mainly related to the CSO, Africa Middle East and Australasia and North America reporting segments. COVID-19 has disrupted the operations of our customers and channel partners, our operations and the results of our operations. COVID-19 currently has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. For example, the continued economic uncertainty in the oil and gas sector has resulted in significant declines in our customer’s fleet sizes whilst similar disruption is evident in our bus and coach vertical following significantly reduced demand for public transport as a result of various governmental shut downs in multiple jurisdictions where we operate. This has and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced a contraction of 73,800 subs cribers as a result of the economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The net contraction in subscribers resulted in a decrease in reported subscription revenues. Cash resources and liquidity Based on our internal projections we believe that we have sufficient cash reserves to support us for the foreseeable future. Further details on our cash resources and borrowings available under our credit facilities are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section below. Financial position and impairments We have taken into account the impact of COVID-19, to the extent possible, on our financial statements as of reporting date. However, future changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19 could have an impact on future estimates and judgements used, particularly those relating to Goodwill sensitivities and impairment assessments, as well as expected credit losses. Refer to note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill sensitivities. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. Key Financial Measures and Operating Metrics In addition to financial measures based on our consolidated financial statements, we monitor our business operations using various financial and non-financial metrics. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue represents subscription fees for our solutions, which include the use of our SaaS fleet management solutions, connectivity, and in many cases, our in-vehicle devices. Our subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of subscribers and the monthly price per subscriber, which varies depending on the services and features customers require, hardware options, customer size and geographic location. Subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in hardware and other revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, subscription revenue represented 85.7%, 87.6% and 89.3% respectively, of our total revenue. In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 24.9%, 23 .7% and 21.8% respectively, of our subscription revenue. Subscribers Subscribers represent the total number of discrete services we provide to customers at the end of the period. 54 Factors Affecting Our Performance Level of Subscription Revenue and Hardware Revenue We have historically been focused on growing our recurring subscription revenue base and entering into more fully bundled deals. As a result of an increase in the total subscriber base, and due to new and existing subscribers moving to fully-bundled subscriptions, subscription revenue has increased as a percentage of revenue. In fiscal year 2021, subscription-based revenues accounted for 89.3% of our total revenues, up from 87.6% in 2020 and 85.7% in 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the level of business disruption as a result of the spread of COVID-19, the Company suspended its practice of issuing financial guidance during fiscal 2021 and has also not provided guidance for fiscal 2022. As market conditions improve globally, we believe that we will be well positioned to grow our base of subscribers, by adding both fully-bundled subscriptions; subscriptions where the hardware has been purchased upfront and various add-on solutions that can drive incremental average revenue per user (“ARPU”) expansion over time. We intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing and continue to attract new subscribers by introducing attractive new features and services. Additionally, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our fleet management market share among our existing customer base by demonstrating our value proposition, growing with the customer, introducing new and innovative value-added solutions and displacing legacy fleet management solutions. Fluctuations in Exchange Rates Revenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, will negatively affect our reported income and expenses as expressed in U.S. Dollars (our reporting currency). The South African Rand is the functional currency for the Company. Currency fluctuations in the South African Rand may positively or negatively impact our reported income and expenses due to the effects of translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries into Rand at different average exchange rates and then translating into our reporting currency of U.S. Dollars. In fiscal year 2021, the Rand weakened by 1 0.8% against the U.S. Dollar and by 13.7% a gainst the British Pound, as shown in the table below. We expect continued exchange rate volatility in the South African Rand against other major currencies. The South African Rand has been even more volatile due to the uncertain economic conditions including the effect of COVID-19 and it is uncertain how long this will continue. As of June 10, 2021, the South African Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 13.65, 16.6% stronger than the average exchange rate for fiscal 2021. Mix of Subscribers with Different Revenue and Cost Economics We offer services to a wide range of customers, from large enterprise vehicle fleets to small fleet operators and consumers. The subscription revenue and cost per subscriber and the subscriber retention pattern differ by type of subscriber. For example, our entry-level consumer solution, Beam-e, is characterized by lower revenue and lower cost per subscriber compared to our large enterprise solutions. Small fleet and consumer customers will enter into and terminate contracts much more frequently than our enterprise customers, thereby affecting subscriber retention. As the mix of our subscriber base evolves, the average revenue per subscriber and average cost per subscriber is likely to change. 55 Varying Economic Conditions in our Markets We seek to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks in our key markets, which are geographically dispersed with subscribers located in more than 120 countries worldwide. Overall, we believe that our presence across multiple geographic markets and our exposure to multiple economies provides us with diversification from the risk of changing economic conditions in any one country or region. Other macroeconomic factors, such as expectations for future crude oil and natural gas prices, affect our customers’ spending habits. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices, or the perception that such prices will decrease in the future, negatively impacts our net subscriber growth and hardware sales in this sector. In addition to macroeconomic changes, performance in any given region may vary due to multiple factors, including growth in subscribers, the overall profile of the customer base (for example, in Africa, we have a significant consumer subscriber base), the services and hardware options selected by particular subscribers and our distribution strategy in the region. Changes in regional conditions require management to formulate strategic responses that safeguard our financial position an d maintain our balanced approach to producing revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. Changing Customer Needs and Ongoing Investment in Technology We continuously analyze market trends and opportunities in the various geographies in which we operate and have identified an opportunity to increase subscription revenue growth by the addition of new products and services in certain of the regions in which we operate. Our investment in software development is core to our business strategy. Our software teams employ an agile software development methodology. We have made a significant investment in product development, and we have routinely been among the first to market with innovative solutions and features that cater to the needs of our customers. For example, major updates to the MiX Vision solution were made in fiscal year 2021, with MiX Vision AI poised for launch in calendar year 2021. Long Sales Cycle for Our Enterprise Fleet Management Solutions From period to period, our revenues may fluctuate depending upon the customer contracts we have secured. The typical sales cycle for large enterprise fleet management solutions contracts may be long, especially in comparison to the sales cycle for our consumer solutions. It may also be difficult for us to predict the timing of when we will enter into enterprise fleet management contracts. Longer sales cycles for large contracts, for both customers who purchase in-vehicle devices and those who opt for the fully bundled option, may affect the comparability of financial results in certain segments. Our revenue may fluctuate from period to period depending on the level and timing of hardware sales, while subscription revenue growth is also impacted by the timing of the rollout of large enterprise fleets. We are focused on mitigating these long sales cycles and the associated volatility by enhancing our sales pipeline management process, by increasing our sales and marketing investment levels across all geographical segments and by diversifying our customer segment focus. Investment in Sales and Marketing We offer our solutions in over 120 countries through a combination of our direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our sales and marketing strategy is segmented by geographic region and customer type in order to cost effectively target and acquire new customers. In certain regions, we sell subscriptions of our fleet management solutions to large enterprise fleets through our direct sales force. In other regions, and for sales to small fleet operators and consumers, we work with an extensive distribution network of regional partners and national distribution dealers. Through our central services organization headquartered in South Africa, we provide optimized marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our regional sales and marketing operations. We continue to focus on growth and expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and to expand within existing customers. Basis of Presentation and Key Components of Our Results of Operations In fiscal year 2021, we managed our business in six segments which include Africa, Americas, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East and Australasia (our regional sales offices (“RSOs”)), and our central services organization (“CSO”). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs which, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments. 56 The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the reportable segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. Segment performance is measured and evaluated by the CODM using Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure which uses net income, determined under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as a starting point. Prior to the publication of the financial results for the year ended March 31, 2020, we published results under IFRS only, which is the reason for the CODM using a segment performance measure based on IFRS. In determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA, the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs. Each RSO’s results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Segment Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as this information is not reviewed by the CODM. Revenue The majority of our revenue is subscription-based. Consequently, growth in subscribers influences our subscription revenue growth. However, other factors, including, but not limited to, the types of new subscribers we add and the timing of entry into subscription contracts also play a significant role. The price and terms of our customer subscription contracts vary based on a number of factors, including fleet size, hardware options, geographic region and distribution channel. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of in-vehicle devices, which are used to collect, generate and transmit the data used to enable our SaaS solutions. Our customer contracts typically have a three to five year initial term. Following the initial term, most fleet customers elect to renew for fixed terms ranging from one to five years. Our third party dealers are typically billed monthly based on active connections. Some of our customer agreements, including our consumer subscriptions, provide for automatic monthly or yearly renewals unless the customer elects not to renew its subscription. Our consumer customer contracts in South Africa are governed by the Consumer Protection Act, which allows customers to cancel without paying the full balance of the contract amount. Our fleet contracts and our customer contracts outside of South Africa are generally non-cancellable. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue associated with our subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to cellular communications, infrastructure hosting, third-party data providers, service contract maintenance costs, commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors (commission is capitalized and amortized unless the amortization period is 12 months or less) and depreciation of our capitalized installed in-vehicle devices. Cost of sales associated with our hardware revenue includes the cost of the in-vehicle devices, cost of hardware warranty, shipping costs, custom duties, and commission expense related to third party dealers or distributors. We capitalize the cost of in-vehicle devices utilized to service customers, for customers selecting our bundled option, and we depreciate these costs from the date of installation over their expected useful lives. We expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period depending on our revenue mix, including the proportion of our revenue attributable to our subscription-based services. The majority of the other components of our cost of revenue are variable and are affected by the number of subscribers, the composition of our subscriber base, and the number of new subscriptions sold in the period. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages to sales and marketing employees, commissions paid to employees, travel-related expenses, and advertising and promotional costs. We pay our sales employees commissions based on achieving subscription targets and we capitalize commission and amortize it (unless the amortization period is 12 months or less). Advertising costs consist primarily of costs for print, radio and television advertising, promotions, public relations, customer events, tradeshows and sponsorships. We expense advertising costs as incurred. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our sales and build brand and category awareness. 57 Administration and Other Charges Administration and other charges consist primarily of salaries and wages for administrative staff, travel costs, professional fees (including audit and legal fees), real estate leasing costs, expensed research and development costs and depreciation of fixed assets including vehicles and office equipment and amortization of intangible assets. We expect that administration and other charges will increase in absolute terms as we continue to grow our business.

Taxes In fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 our effective tax rates were 39.9%, 47.2% and 15.3% r espectively, compared to a South African statutory rate of 28%. Taxation mainly consists of normal statutory income tax paid or payable and deferred tax on any temporary differences. Our effective tax rate may vary primarily according to the mix of profits made in various jurisdictions and the impact of certain non-deductible/(non-taxable) foreign exchange movements, net of tax. A reconciliation of the actual tax rate to the South African tax rate of 28% is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, significant variances in future periods may occur. 58 Results of operations The following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statement of Income data: 59 Results of Operations for Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021 Revenue Our total revenue decreased by $18.8 million or 12.9%, f rom fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. The principal factors affecting our revenue contraction included: • Subscription revenue decreased by 11.1% to $113.4 million, compared to $127.6 million f or fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 89.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% for the prior year. Subscription revenues decreased by 6.1% on a constant currency basis, year over year. The decline in constant currency subscription revenue was primarily due to the contraction in our subscriber base as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal year 2021, our subscriber base contracted by 73,800 subscribers to 744,700 subscribers at March 31, 2021. We experienced fleet contraction in a number of key verticals such as the oil and gas vertical, consumer vertical and leasing vertical which impacted both our subscriber-count and subscription revenue line, the contraction is mainly attributable to our low ARPU asset tracking subscribers. The majority of our revenues and subscription revenues are derived from currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies (in particular against the South African Rand) following currency volatility arising from the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, has negatively impacted our revenue and subscription revenues reported in U.S. Dollars. Compared to fiscal year 2020, the South African Rand weakened by 11% against the U.S. Dollar. The Rand/U.S. Dollar exchange rate averaged R16.37 in fiscal year 2021 compared to an average of R14.78 during fiscal year 2020. The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 5.0% reduction in reported U.S. Dollar subscription revenues. • Hardware and other revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 25.1%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of a global economic slowdown following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown in the table below, hardware and other revenue was lower across all geographical segments . The impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates during fiscal year 2021 led to a 4.6% re duction in reported U.S. Dollar revenues. 60 A breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below: In the Africa segment, subscripti on revenue decreased by $8.4 million or 11.9%. On a constant currency basis, the contraction in subscription revenue was 3.4% as a result of a 10.1% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 6.4%. Total revenue decreased by $8.8 million or 11.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue contraction was 3.1%. In the Americas segment, subscription revenue declined by $4.1 million or 18.4% as a result of both a 27.7% decrease in subscribers since April 1, 2020 and as a result of economic conditions in the oil and gas vertical. Included in fiscal year 2021 subscription revenue reported above is revenue of $1.1 million pertaining to the reduction of existing subscriber contracts of a significant energy sector customer, following a reduction of their fleet due to current economic conditions. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million or 65.1%. Total revenue declined by $5.5 million or 22.6% . Subscription revenue i n the Middle East and Australasia segment declined by $0.8 million or 4.8%. On a constant currency basis, the decline in subscription revenue was 7.2%. Subscribers decreased by 1.8% since April 1, 2020. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.1 million or 18.5%. Total revenue declined by $1.9 million or 8.2%. Total revenue in constant currency declined by 10.7%. In the Europe segment, subscription revenue growth was $0.5 million or 3.9%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 0.3%. Subscribers increased by 0.5% since April 1, 2020. Total revenue decreased by $0.4 million or 3.0%, due to a decrease in hardware and other revenues of $0.9 million compared to fiscal year 2020. Total revenue decreased by 6.4% on a constant currency basis. In the Brazil segment, subscription revenue declined by $1.3 million or 24.3%. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue decreased by 0.5%. Subscribers increased by 3.9% since April 1, 2020 which was offset by pricing concessions granted to customers as a result of economic conditions attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hardware and other revenue declined by $0.5 million or 76.9%. Total revenue declined by $1.7 million or 29.9%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue decreased by 7.8%. 61 Cost of Revenue Compared to a decrease in total revenue of $18.8 million or 12.9%, cost of revenues decreased by $9.2 million or 1 7.3% , from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. Subscription revenue, which generates a higher gross profit margin than hardware and other revenue, contributed 89.3% of total revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared to 87.6% in fiscal year 2020. Fiscal 2020 included $2.0 million in-vehicle device accelerated depreciation which resulted in an increased subscription revenue margin in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. During fiscal year 2021, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2021, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs decreased by $2.0 million, or 14.9%, from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 against a 12.9% dec rease in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily as a result of savings of $1.0 million in employee costs, $0.7 million in travel costs and other decreases of $0.3 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2021, sales and marketing costs repr esented 8.9% of revenue compared to 9.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2020. Administration and Other Expenses Administration and other expenses decreased by $4.8 million, or 8.2%, fro m fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. The decrease mainly relat es to savings of $4.1 million in salaries and wages, travel costs of $0.8 million and decreases in expected credit loss provision of $1.0 million, offset by restructuring costs of $1.1 million. 62 Taxation Income tax expense decreased by 73.2%. Our effective tax rate decreased by 31.9% to 15.3% in fiscal year 2021. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2021 the effective tax rate decreased by 19.7% as a result of certain non-taxable foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2020 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 19.6%. Results of Operations for Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020 Revenue Our total revenue increased by $1.9 million or 1.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 6.3% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. The principal factors affecting our revenue growth included: • Subscription revenue grew by $4.4 million, or 3.6% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. Subscription revenue represented 87.6% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 85.7% for the prior year. Our growth in subscription revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in subscribers, which increased by 9.1% from 750,455 at March 31, 2019, to 818,487 at March 31, 2020. There was no material movement in ARPUs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue increased by 8.7% from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. • Hardware and other revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 12.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. 63 A breakdown of third party revenue by segment is shown in the table below: In the Africa segment, subscription revenue increased by $0.4 million or 0.5%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 7.5% as a result of a 8.6% increase in subscribers since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1.0%. Hardware and other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 7.6%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth was 8.0%. In the Americas segment subscription revenue growth was $1.0 million or 4.9%. Subscribers increased by 1.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue improved by $0.6 million or 2.5%. Subscription revenue in the Middle East and Australasia segment increased by $1.0 million or 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 9.3%. Subscribers increased by 10.5% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue declined by $0.4 million or 1.7%. Hardware and other revenue declined by $1.4 million, or 19.0%. Total revenue in constant currency improved by 1.7%. In the Europe segment subscription revenue growth was $1.5 million or 14.3%. On a constant currency basis, the growth in subscription revenue was 18.0%. Subscribers increased by 10.8% since April 1, 2019 and additional growth is attributable to an increase in high ARPU bundled subscribers. Despite the increase in subscription revenue total revenue declined by $0.2 million or 1.5%, due to $1.7 million lower hardware and other revenues compared to fiscal 2019. Total revenue increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis. In the Brazil segment subscription revenue increased by $0.5 million or 11.3%. On a constant currency basis, the increase in subscription revenue was 20.9%. The increase was due to an increase in subscribers of 25.9% since April 1, 2019. Total revenue increased by $0.8 million or 16.5%. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased by 26.5%. 64 Cost of Revenue Compared to an increase in total revenue of $1.9 million or 1.4%, cost of revenues increased by $6.1 million or 13.1%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This resulted in a lower gross profit margin of 63.6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 67.4% in fiscal year 2019. During fiscal 2020, subscription revenue gross profit margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to accelerated depreciation of in-vehicle devices following contraction in certain fleets in the oil and gas vertical in the Americas segment. During fiscal 2020, hardware and other margins were lower than in fiscal 2019, mainly due to the geographical sales mix and the distribution channels. Hardware sales via our dealer channel attract lower gross margins. In addition there is pricing pressure on hardware prices as customers look to reduce the upfront cost of their investment. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs decreased by $1.2 million or 8.0%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 against a 1.4% increase in total revenue. The decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily as a result of a $0.5 million decrease in bonuses, a $0.5 million decrease in salaries and wages, a $0.1 million decrease in foreign travel costs and other decreases of $0.1 million, none of which were individually significant. In fiscal year 2020, sales and marketing costs repr esented 9.1% of revenue compared to 10.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2019. Administration and Other Expenses Administration and other expenses increased by $0.2 million or 0.4%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. 65 The increase mainly relates to increases in expected credit loss provision primarily in the South Africa business of $1.9 million mainly, professional fees of $0.9 million, offset by saving in bonuses of $1.3 million primarily due to lower subscription revenue growth being achieved, salaries and wages of $0.8 million and operating lease costs of $0.4 million. Taxation Income tax expense increased by 0.1%, while our effective tax rate increased by 7.3% to 47.2% in fiscal year 2020. A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the South African corporate tax rate of 28% for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, is presented in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2020 the effective tax rate increased by 19.6% as a result of certain non-deductible foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans which have led to deferred tax charges being recognized in the Income Statement. In fiscal 2019 non-deductible foreign exchange differences increased the tax rate by 14.0%. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-GAAP Financial Information We use certain measures to assess the financial performance of our business. Certain of these measures are termed “non-GAAP measures” because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and constant currency information. An explanation of the relevance of each of the non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out below. We do not regard these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are two of the profit measures reviewed by the CODM. We define Adjusted EBITDA as the income before income taxes, net interest income, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized internal-use software development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, stock-based compensation costs, restructuring costs and profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this annual report because they are key measures that our management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful 66 measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. A reconciliation of net income (the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year is presented below. (1) Includes depreciation of owned equipment (including in-vehicle devices). (2) Includes amortization of intangible assets (including intangible assets identified as part of a business combination). Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered as performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; • other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure; and • certain of the adjustments (such as restructuring costs, impairment of long-lived assets and others) made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are those that management believes are not representative of our underlying operations and, therefore, are subjective in nature. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including income from operations, net income and our other results. Basic and Diluted non-GAAP Net Income per share Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. 67 We have included non-GAAP net income per share in this Annual Report because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax and associated tax consequences from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. Constant Currency Information Constant currency information has been presented in the sections below to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on our results. The constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year’s results to the prior year’s average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of our currencies, including the South African Rand and British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results. The constant currency information represents non-GAAP information. We believe this provides a useful basis to measure the performance of our business as it removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements during the period. Due to the significant portion of our customers who are invoiced in non-U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, we also calculate our subscription revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis, thereby removing the effect of currency fluctuation on our results of operations. Refer to discussion below for the annual constant currency growth. The following tables provide the constant currency reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the fiscal years shown: Subscription Revenue 68 Hardware and Other Revenue Total Revenue 69 Liquidity and capital resources We believe that our cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Liquidity risk is reduced as a result of stable income due to the recurring nature of our income, available cash resources, as well as unutilized facilities which are available. The following tables provide a summary of our cash flows for each of the three years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021: We fund our operations, capital expenditure and acquisitions through cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand and our undrawn borrowing facilities. It is currently our policy to pay regular dividends, and we consider such dividend payments on a quarter-by-quarter basis. As of March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company had approved, but not yet contracted, capital commitments for intangible assets of $3.6 million, $3.0 million and $4.7 million respectively. As of March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company had approved, and contracted, capital commitments for property and equipment of $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively; and for intangible assets of $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million respectively. Capital commitments will be funded out of a mixture of working capital and cash and cash equivalen ts. On May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Limited Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million (equivalent of $18.1 million as of March 31, 2021) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including ADSs. We expect any repurchases under this share repurchase program to be funded out of existing cash resources. During fiscal year 2021, there were no additional share repurchases. Refer to “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for information regarding our share repurchase program. Operating Activities Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2019 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $47.6 million, a net investment in operating assets and liabilities of $10.6 million, net interest received of $0.7 million and taxes paid of $6.2 million. Net cash generated from operating activities dec reased from $31.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 which is primarily attributable to more net income (after excluding non-cash charges) before operating assets and liabilities changes of $4.8 million offset by negative net operating assets and liabilities changes of $8.2 million, lower net interest received of $0.2 million and lower taxation paid of $0.4 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2020 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $52.3 70 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $18.8 million, net interest received of $0.5 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million. Net cash generated from operating activities inc reased from $28.2 million in fiscal year 2020 to $38.6 million in fiscal year 2021 which is primarily attributable to improved cash generated from operations of $10.5 million offset by lower net interest received of $0.1 million. The improved cash generated from operations is primarily as a result of improved working capital management of $17.9 million (specifically a decrease in accounts receivables of $9.2 million due to improved management of receivables and lower revenues, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.6 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $6.0 million, and lower capitalized commissions of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payables of $5.9 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.6 million and an increase in inventories of $0.4 million), offset by lower net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $6.8 million. Net cash generated from operating activities during fiscal year 2021 consisted of our net income (after excluding non-cash charges) of $45.6 million, a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities investments of $1.6 million, net interest received of $0.3 million and taxes paid of $5.8 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 was $19.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $19.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.8 million, which included internal-use software of $3.5 million, as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.3 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.9 million. Offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 increased to $19.4 million from $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $5.7 million, which included internal-use software of $3.4 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $2.3 million, and c ash paid to purchase property and equipment of $14.7 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $13.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities also included $ 0.3 million loan advanced to third parties offset by proceeds on sale of property and equipment and intangible assets of $1.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 decreased to $8.7 million from $19.4 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower in-vehicle devices capital expenditure as a result of lower revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2021 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $8.7 million. Capital expenditures during the year included purchases of intangible assets of $4.0 million, which included inte rnal-use software of $2.8 million as well as computer software, technology and other intangibles of $1.2 million, and cash paid to purchase property and equipment of $4.6 million, which included in-vehicle devices of $4.2 million. Financing Activities In fiscal year 2019, the cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million includes share repurchases of $5.3 million, dividends paid of $4.9 million, offset by proceeds from issuance of shares in respect of employee stock options of $1.0 million and $0.7 million from facilities utilized . In fiscal year 2020, the cash used in financing activities of $15.5 million includes share repurchases of $9.8 million, dividends paid of $6.0 million, offset by $0.3 million from facilities utilized. I n fiscal year 2021, the cash used in financing activities of $5.2 million includes dividends paid of $5.4 million and $0.7 million from facilities repaid, offset by proceeds of $0.9 million from the issue of ordinary shares in relation to the exercise of stock options. 71 Credit Facilities At March 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were net cash balances of $43.8 m illion (consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $45.5 million less short-term debt (bank overdraft)) of $1.7 m illion) and unutilized borrowing capacity of $5.5 million available through our credit facilities. Our principal sources of credit are our facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited. We have an overdraft facility of R64.0 million (equivalent of $4.3 million as of March 31, 2021), an unutilized working capital facility of R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) and an unutilized vehicle and asset finance facility of R8.5 million (equivalent o f $0.6 million a s of March 31, 2021) with Standard Bank Limited that bear interest at South African Prime less 1.2% except for the working capital facility that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%. At March 31, 20 21, $1.7 million was utilized under the overdraft f acility. We use this facility as part of our foreign currency hedging strategy. We draw down on this facility in the applicable foreign currency in order to fix the exchange rate on existing balance sheet foreign currency exposure that we anticipate settling in that foreign currency. Our obligations under the overdraft facility with Standard Bank Limited are guaranteed by MiX Telematics Limited and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited, and secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by MiX Telematics Limited and MiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited. During fiscal year 2020, we entered into a R25.0 million (equivalent of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2021) working capital facility with Standard Bank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 0.25%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations. During fiscal year 2014, we entered into a R10.0 million (equivalent of $0.7 million as of March 31, 2021) facility with Nedbank Limited that bears interest at South African Prime less 2%. As of March 31, 2021, the facility was undrawn. We use this facility for working capital purposes in our Africa operations. Our credit facilities with Standard Bank Limited and Nedbank Limited contain certain restrictive clauses, including without limitation, those limiting our and our guarantor subsidiaries’, as applicable, ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, or sell or acquire assets or businesses. These facilities are not subject to any financial covenants such as interest coverage or gearing ratios. 72 Contractual and other obligations The following table sets forth our future annual repayment of debt, and our contractual commitments as of March 31, 2021 (U.S. Dollar amounts were translated from South African Rand at the exchange rate of R14.9167 per $1.00, which is the exchange rate as of March 31, 2021): (1) Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on leases. (2) Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on short-term debt (bank overdraft). (3) Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on capital commitments. (4) Outstanding purchase obligations primarily represent agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to production of our products, information technology services and employee benefit administration services. 73 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are summarized below. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the amortization period for deferred commissions, allowances for doubtful accounts, the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, the determination of useful lives of our customer relationships, contingencies, the classification of devices and other hardware as in-vehicle devices (equipment) versus inventory based on the future expectation of the different types of customer contracts, income and deferred taxes, and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Revenue from Contracts with Customers Significant Judgments Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of distinct promised products and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and/or services. We enter into contracts that include the supply of fleet and mobile asset management equipment. For such contracts, we utilize significant judgment to determine whether control of the equipment has transferred to the customer, and in instances where it does, we recognize revenue in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). When control of the equipment does not transfer to the customer, which is when legal title does not transfer to the customer, our judgement is that the customer does not have the right to direct the use of the equipment when the customer does not operate the equipment or make any significant decisions about its use. In these instances we use the equipment to provide fleet and mobile asset management services to the customer. Accordingly, these arrangements, which comprise virtually all of the transactions in which legal title does not pass to the customer, are not within the scope of ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). Instead, for such contracts we have concluded that they are service contracts comprising a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized over time pursuant to ASC 606. Recognition and measurement We provide fleet and mobile asset management solutions to our customers, and our principal revenue streams are (1) Subscription and (2) Hardware and other. Subscription revenue is recognized over time and hardware and other revenue is recognized at a point-in-time. To provide services to customers, a device is required which collects and transmits information collected from the vehicle or other asset. Fleet customers may also obtain other items of hardware, virtually all of which are functionally-dependent on the device. Some customers obtain control of the device and other hardware (where legal title transfers to the customer); while other customers do not (where legal title remains with the Company). A contract arises on the acceptance of a customer’s purchase order, which is typically executed in writing. We distribute devices and other hardware to certain small fleet operators and consumers through distributors. Distributors act as agents and hardware revenue is only recognized when the distributor sells the hardware unit to the end customer. Once a unit is sold to a customer, the customer enters into a service agreement directly with us. The obligation to supply the service and the credit risk rests with us. The subscription revenue is recognized when the service is rendered. We also sell hardware to motor vehicle dealerships for fitment into their vehicle trading stock. These dealerships purchase the hardware from us and are considered to act as a principal in the contract because they obtain title to the hardware, bear the risks and rewards of ownership and accordingly control the hardware purchased. The buyer of the vehicle then enters into a service-only contract with us. Revenue is recognized upon sale of the hardware to the dealership and subscription revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. We distribute devices and other hardware to enterprise fleet customers through dealers. Dealers are considered to act as a principal for the sale of hardware to the end customer, and revenue is recognized by us upon sale of the hardware unit to the dealer. Dealers are also considered to act as a principal for the provision of the service to end customers because, even though the dealers do not provide the service themselves, the dealers control the right to receive the service before that right is transferred to the end customer, the dealers have the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the end customer, and the dealers have full discretion in establishing the prices charged to the end customer. Accordingly, subscription revenue is recognized as the service is provided to the dealers. 74 Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivables is calculated by considering all relevant information, internal and external about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to appropriately reflect the risk of losses over the remaining contractual lives of the assets. Historical loss rates, calculated as actual losses over a period as a percentage of revenue, are adjusted for current conditions and management’s expectations about future economic conditions. The allowance is measured on a collective basis where management groups their customers appropriately based on their credit risk characteristics. The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account and the asset’s carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Actual write-downs are recorded when the asset is deemed uncollectible after all efforts to recover have yielded no results. Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for possible impairment at least annually, or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying value of the reporting unit, to which goodwill has been allocated, is compared to its fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount (if any) by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of the goodwill. No impairments of goodwill existed as of the last testing date, March 31, 2021 or the previous testing, March 31, 2020. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are attributable only to foreign currency translation adjustments. Although there were no impairments of goodwill as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, significant judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of each reporting unit, in particular judgements regarding the discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital rate), the expected future cash flows and terminal growth rates. Especially in light of COVID-19, which has had and, we believe, will continue to have an adverse impact on global economies and financial markets. In particular, to the extent that anticipated new contracts do not materialize and the business strategy does not come to fruition, or key personnel are not retained, the forecasts on which the impairment tests were performed could be negatively impacted. Taxation We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. During the process of determining our world-wide provision for income taxes, we are required to make judgements in respect of international tax matters, including transfer pricing and controlled foreign company legislation. Where applicable tax legislation is subject to interpretation, management makes assessments, based on expert tax advice, of the relevant tax that is more likely than not to be paid and provides accordingly. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income tax expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. We use the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and tax rates enacted by the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable income. Interest, and penalties, incurred on the underpayment of income taxes is classified as interest expense, and administration expenses, respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax balances and associated valuation allowances represent management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimate. 75 Deferred tax liabilities arising on investments in domestic subsidiaries are not recognized to the extent that the investment can be recovered on a tax-free basis; and on investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the undistributed earnings will be invested indefinitely or will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. Off-balance sheet arrangements We do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities. We do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities which are not consolidated. 76",
1084048,"In addition to historical information, the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the Risk Factors and the risk factors set forth in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC. Overview J2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“J2 Global”, “the Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet services. Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming, and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. Our Cloud Services business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and businesses including cloud fax, cybersecurity, privacy, and marketing technology. We manage our operations through two businesses: Digital Media and Cloud Services. Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees. Our Cloud Services business generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees. In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets. Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. Our Cloud Services business is driven primarily by subscription revenues that are relatively higher margin, stable and predictable from quarter to quarter with minor seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the variability of our revenues. J2 Global was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure, and our Cloud Services business, operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, J2 Cloud Services, LLC (formerly J2 Cloud Services, Inc.), and its subsidiaries, was founded in 1995. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, and we anticipate our customers and our operations in all locations will be affected as the virus continues to proliferate and as a result of the governmental responses to the pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility and overall uncertainty. Given this disruption, volatility and uncertainty, our results may be adversely affected due to various factors affecting our performance. The Company has adjusted certain aspects of our operations to protect our employees and customers while still seeking to meet customers’ needs for our vital cloud internet services and digital media services. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and will take further action to alter our operations as may be required by federal, foreign, state and local authorities or that we determine are otherwise necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. The full extent, duration and overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown and depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable. Therefore, we are continuing to assess the impact to our results of operations, financial position and liquidity based on our current assessment of the situation which could change based on the spread of the pandemic and additional government action which could limit economic activity or cause for a slower reopening of the economy. -44- Digital Media Performance Metrics We use certain metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our Digital Media business. The number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers’ level of engagement with our mobile applications, websites and other services. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to participate in advertising programs and other activities that derive our multiple revenue streams. We define a visit as a group of interactions by users with our mobile and desktop applications and websites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. We measure visits with Google Analytics and through partner platform measures. Page views are measured each time a page on our websites is loaded in a browser. The following table sets forth certain key operating metrics for our Digital Media business for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): Sources: Google Analytics and Partner Platforms Cloud Services Performance Metrics We use certain metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our Cloud Services business; these metrics also serve as a baseline for (a) internal trends and (b) benchmarking against competitors. The average monthly revenue per customer can be used as an analytical tool in determining the marginal economics of customer acquisition, which is particularly useful as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. We also use this metric, in conjunction with the cancel rate, to help provide a directional indicator of Cloud Services revenue and calculate the lifetime value of customers within each of our business units. -45- The following table sets forth certain key operating metrics for our Cloud Services business for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except for percentages): (1) Quarterly ARPU is calculated using our standard convention of applying the average of the quarter’s beginning and ending base to the total revenue for the quarter. We believe ARPU provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize associated with each Cloud Services customer. As ARPU varies based on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, we believe it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across our Cloud Services customer base. (2) Cloud Services customers are defined as paying direct inward dialing numbers for fax and voice services, and direct and resellers’ accounts for other services. (3) Cancel Rate is defined as cancels of small and medium businesses and individual Cloud Services customers with greater than four months of continuous service (continuous service includes Cloud Services customers administratively canceled and reactivated within the same calendar month), and enterprise Cloud Services customers beginning with their first day of service. Calculated monthly and expressed as an average over the three months of the quarter. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may be material. We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of investments, our assessment of ownership interests as variable interest entities and the related determination of consolidation, share-based compensation expense, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, long-lived and intangible asset impairment, contingent consideration, income taxes and contingencies -46- and allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider these policies critical because they are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Digital Media Digital Media revenues are earned primarily from the delivery of advertising services and from subscriptions to services and information. Revenue is earned from the delivery of advertising services on the Company’s owned and operated websites and on those websites that are part of Digital Media’s advertising network. Depending on the individual contracts with the customer, revenue for these services are recognized over the contract period when any of the following performance obligations are satisfied: (i) when an advertisement is placed for viewing; (ii) when a qualified sales lead is delivered; (iii) when a visitor “clicks through” on an advertisement; or (iv) when commissions are earned upon the sale of an advertised product. Revenue from subscriptions is earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers. Subscriptions cover video games and related content, health information, data and other copyrighted material. Revenues under such agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the service. Revenues are also earned from listing fees, subscriptions to online publications, and from other sources. Subscription revenues are recognized over time. J2 Global also generates Digital Media revenues through the license of certain assets to clients. Assets are licensed for clients’ use in their own promotional materials or otherwise. Such assets may include logos, editorial reviews, or other copyrighted material. Revenues under such license agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the asset. Technology assets are also licensed to clients. These assets are recognized over the term of the access period. The Digital Media business also generates revenue from other sources which had included marketing and production services. Such other revenues are generally recognized over the period in which the products or services are delivered. J2 Global also generates Digital Media revenues from transactions involving the sale of perpetual software licenses, related software support and maintenance, hardware used in conjunction with its software, and other related services. Revenue is recognized for these software transactions with multiple performance obligations after (i) the Company has had an approved contract and is committed to perform the respective obligations and (ii) the Company can identify and quantify each obligation and its respective selling price. Once the respective performance obligations have been identified and quantified, revenue will be recognized when the obligations are met, either over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the obligation. Revenues from software license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues for related software support and maintenance performance obligations are related to technical support provided to customers as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period when they are available. The Company is obligated to make the support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period the support services are provided. Hardware product and related software performance obligations, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a bundled performance obligation. The revenues for this bundled performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware and software products are delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer. Other service revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to revenue generated (i) by the Company serving online display and video advertising across its owned and operated web properties, on third-party sites or on unaffiliated advertising networks; (ii) through the Company’s lead-generation business; and (iii) through the Company’s subscriptions. The Company records revenue on a net basis with respect to revenue paid to the Company by certain third-party advertising networks who serve online display and video advertising across the Company’s owned-and-operated web properties and certain third-party sites. -47- Cloud Services The Company’s Cloud Services revenues substantially consist of monthly recurring subscription and usage-based fees, the majority of which are paid in advance by credit card. The Company defers the portions of monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually recurring subscription and usage-based fees collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes them in the period earned. Along with our numerous proprietary Cloud Services solutions, the Company also generates revenues by reselling various third-party solutions, primarily through our email security and online backup lines of business. These third-party solutions, along with our proprietary products, allow the Company to offer customers a variety of solutions to better meet the customer’s needs. The Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to reseller revenue because the Company has control of the specified good or service prior to transferring control to the customer. Valuation and Impairment of Investments We account for our investments in debt securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic No. 320, Investments - Debt Securities (“ASC 320”). Our debt investments are typically comprised of corporate debt securities, which we classify as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. All debt securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis. The Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are carried at an estimated fair value with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in loss on investments, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. We account for our investments in equity securities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 321, Investments - Equity Securities (“ASC 321”) which requires the accounting for equity investments (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) generally be measured at fair value for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value that are not accounted for by the equity method, we measure the equity security using cost, less impairment, if any, and plus or minus observable price changes arising from orderly transactions in the same or similar investment from the same issuer. Any unrealized gains or losses will be reported in current earnings (see Note 5 - Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference). We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions (see Note 5 - Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference). -48- Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”) A VIE requires consolidation by the entity’s primary beneficiary. We evaluate our investments in entities in which we are involved to determine if the entity is a VIE and if so, whether we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we hold a variable interest in our investment as a limited partner in the OCV Fund I, LP (“OCV Fund”, “OCV” or the “Fund”). In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, both of the following characteristics must be present: a) the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIEs economic performance (the power criterion); and b) the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, or the right to receive benefits of the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE (the economic criterion). We have concluded that, as a limited partner, although the obligations to absorb losses or the right to benefit from the gains is not insignificant, we do not have “power” over OCV because we do not have the ability to direct the significant decisions which impact the economics of OCV. We believe that the OCV general partner, as a single decision maker, holds the ability to make the decisions about the activities that most significantly impact the OCV Fund’s economic performance. As a result, we have concluded that we will not consolidate OCV, as we are not the primary beneficiary of the OCV Fund, and will account for this investment under the equity-method of accounting. See Note 5, “Investments”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. OCV qualifies as an investment company under ASC 946 - Financial Services, Investment Companies (“ASC 946”). Under ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, an investor that holds investments that qualify for specialized industry accounting for investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 should record its share of the earnings or losses, realized or unrealized, as reported by its equity method investees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recognize our equity in the net earnings or losses relating to the investment in OCV on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If we become aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which we identify the decline. Share-Based Compensation Expense We account for share-based awards to employees and non-employees in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Accordingly, we measure share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employee’s requisite service period using the straight-line method. The measurement of share-based compensation expense is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend rate and award cancellation rate. These inputs are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in determining share-based compensation expense and the actual factors, which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future share-based compensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. The Company estimates the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived and Intangible Assets J2 Global accounts for long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives (subject to amortization), in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”), which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected undiscounted future net cash flows generated by the asset. If it is determined that the asset may not be recoverable, and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference. -49- We assess the impairment of identifiable definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following: • Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; • Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; • Significant negative industry or economic trends; • Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and • Our market capitalization relative to net book value. If we determined that the carrying value of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. We have assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying amount of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairments of certain operating right-of-use assets and associated property and equipment (see Note 11 - Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference). No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018. The Company classifies its long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period (i) it has approved and committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the asset is probable, (v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until the date of sale. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company stops recording depreciation expense on the asset. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP and uses estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Such estimates may be based on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions such as, but not limited to, revenue growth rates, gross margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and terminal growth rate assumptions. We use established valuation techniques and may engage reputable valuation specialists to assist with the valuations. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies and other intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the period of estimated economic benefit ranging from one to 20 years and are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment pursuant to FASB ASC Topic No. 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In connection with the annual impairment test for goodwill, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it -50- is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the impairment test upon goodwill. The impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In 2020, we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for the Digital Media business from December 31 to October 1, as we determined this date is preferable, and concluded this was not a material change in accounting principle. Contingent Consideration Certain of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future income thresholds or other metrics. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based upon our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved. The fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former shareholders of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination. We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference). We may use various valuation techniques depending on the terms and conditions of the contingent consideration including a Monte-Carlo simulation. This simulation uses probability distribution for each significant input to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes and the results are analyzed to determine probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Significant increases or decreases to these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amount paid in excess of the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities. We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could be materially different from the initial estimates or prior quarterly amounts. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities and adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. -51- Income Taxes Our income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. GAAP also requires that deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. In assessing this valuation allowance, we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted the 2017 Tax Act. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Income Tax Contingencies We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year. ASC 740 provides guidance on the minimum threshold that an uncertain income tax position is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions taken by a company. ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the income tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain income tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate uncertain income tax positions and establish or release reserves as appropriate under GAAP. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be -52- materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. In addition, we may be subject to examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Non-Income Tax Contingencies We do not collect and remit sales and use, telecommunication, or similar taxes in certain jurisdictions where we believe that such taxes are not applicable or legally required. Several states and other taxing jurisdictions have presented or threatened us with assessments, alleging that we are required to collect and remit such taxes there. We are currently under audit or is subject to audit for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. We have a $22.5 million reserve established for these matters which is included in other long-term liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. It is reasonably possible that additional liabilities could be incurred resulting in additional expense, which could have a materially impact on our financial results. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past due status. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectations of their impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 Digital Media We expect revenue for fiscal year 2021 to be higher compared to the prior-year due to the acquisition of RetailMeNot, subject to the continued risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the Digital Media business to improve as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online, but these initiatives will be offset by the impact of COVID-19 in the near term. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks. The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins. We expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain the same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or -53- acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods. Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space but with different business models may impact Digital Media’s overall profit margins. Cloud Services Given the uncertainty of the current macroeconomic environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect 2021 revenue to be higher compared to the prior-year. The main focus of our Cloud Services offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security of our customers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. We expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain the same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods. Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space but with different business models may impact Cloud Services’ overall profit margins. Also, as IP licensing often involves litigation, the timing of licensing transactions is unpredictable and can and does vary significantly from period to period. This variability can cause the overall business’s financial results to materially vary from period to period. J2 Global Consolidated Based on the trends discussed above with respect to our Cloud Services and Digital Media businesses, we anticipate our consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2021 to be higher compared to the prior-year comparable period. We expect operating profit as a percentage of revenues to generally decrease in the future primarily due to the fact that revenue with respect to our Digital Media business (i) is increasing as a percentage of our revenue on a consolidated basis and (ii) has historically operated at a lower operating margin. The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, information derived from our Statements of Operations as a percentage of revenues. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -54- Revenues Our revenues consist of revenues from our Digital Media business and from our Cloud Services business. Digital Media revenues primarily consist of advertising revenues, subscriptions earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers, fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Our revenues have increased over the past three years primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth; partially offset by declines in certain areas of both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is primarily comprised of costs associated with network operations, content fees, editorial and production costs, customer service, database hosting and online processing fees. The decrease in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower content fees, campaign fulfillment cost, other editorial and production costs; partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization The increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to fiscal 2018 that resulted in additional campaign fulfillment, partner inventory, network operations and customer service costs. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing costs consist primarily of internet-based advertising, sales and marketing, personnel costs and other business development-related expenses. Our internet-based advertising relationships consist primarily of fixed cost and performance-based (cost-per-impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition) advertising relationships with an array of online service providers. Advertising cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $163.7 million (primarily consisting of $91.5 million of third-party advertising costs and $57.7 million of personnel costs), $158.2 million (primarily consisting of $112.4 million of third-party advertising costs and $41.3 million of personnel costs) and $149.7 million (primarily consisting of $100.5 million of third-party advertising costs and $40.8 million of personnel costs), respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the businesses acquired in and subsequent to fiscal 2019. The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the businesses acquired in and subsequent to fiscal 2018. -55- Research, Development and Engineering . Our research, development and engineering costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses. The increase in research, development and engineering costs from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired within the Digital Media business. The increase in research, development and engineering costs from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to personnel costs associated with acquisitions within the Digital Media business. General and Administrative. Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the recognition of lease asset impairments and additional depreciation due to leasehold impairments, legal settlements and increased professional fees; partially offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets. The increase in general and administrative expense from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, increased depreciation expense and personnel costs relating to acquisitions closed during 2018 and 2019. Share-Based Compensation The following table represents share-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues and operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Non-Operating Income and Expenses Interest expense, net . Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense, net was $132.0 million, $69.5 million, and $62.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with the issuance of our 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2019; and the payment of certain prepayment penalties and write off of issuance costs in connection with the refinancing of our 6.0% Senior Notes and associated issuance of our 4.625% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2020. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our line of credit borrowings and issuance of our 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2019. -56- Gain on sale of businesses. Our gain on sale of businesses is generated primarily from the sale of certain Voice assets in Australia and New Zealand in the third quarter of 2020. Gain on sale of businesses was $17.1 million, zero, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Loss on investments, net. Our loss on investments, net is generated from gains or losses from investments in equity and debt securities. Our loss on investments, net was $21.0 million, $4.2 million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our net loss on investments, net increased during fiscal year 2020 versus the prior comparable period due to net losses realized on certain investments as the result of the recapitalization of the investee and overall market volatility. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was attributable to an impairment loss on equity securities. Other (income) expense, net . Our other (income) expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items and gain or losses on currency exchange. Other (income) expense, net was $(31.6) million, $3.7 million, and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change from 2019 to 2020 was attributable to currency exchange gains. The change from 2018 to 2019 was attributable to currency exchange losses. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax regulations (including those related to transfer pricing) and different tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize. When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of $60.2 million after considering substantial restrictions on the utilization of these NOLs due to “ownership changes”, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We estimate that all of the above-mentioned federal NOLs will be available for use before their expiration. $59.7 million of the NOLs expire through the year 2037 and $0.5 million of the NOLs carry forward indefinitely depending on the year the loss was incurred. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has no foreign tax credit carryovers. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had available unrecognized state research and development tax credits of $9.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, which last indefinitely. Income tax expense (benefit) amounted to $68.4 million, $(19.4) million and $44.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 29.7%, (9.7)% and 25.2%, respectively. The increase in our annual effective income tax rate from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to the following: 1. An increase in tax expense during 2020 due to a $53.7 million tax benefit recognized in 2019 from an intra-entity transfer as part of the reorganization of our international operating structure resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset with no comparable event during 2020; and 2. a decrease in the benefit for the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the U.S. (relative to income from U.S. domestic operations); and 3. an increase in tax expense during 2020 due to recording valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers. -57- The decrease in our annual effective income tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the following: 1. a decrease during 2019 from an intra-entity transfer as part of the reorganization of our international operating structure resulting in recognition of a $53.7 million tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset; and 2. a decrease in tax expense during 2019 from an overall reduction in our net reserve for uncertain tax positions; partially offset by 3. a decrease in the benefit for the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the U.S. (relative to income from U.S. domestic operations). In order to provide additional understanding in connection with our foreign taxes, the following represents the statutory and effective tax rate by significant foreign country: (1) Effective tax rate excludes certain discrete items. The statutory tax rate is the rate imposed on taxable income for corporations by the local government in that jurisdiction. The effective tax rate measures the taxes paid as a percentage of pretax profit. The effective tax rate can differ from the statutory tax rate when a company can exempt some income from tax, claim tax credits, or due to the effect of book-tax differences that do not reverse and discrete items. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Certain of these tax positions have in the past been, and are currently being, challenged, and this may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate if our tax reserves are insufficient. Equity Method Investment Net loss in earnings of equity method investment. Net loss in earnings of equity method investment is generated from our investment in the OCV Fund for which we receive annual audited financial statements. The investment in the OCV Fund is presented net of tax and on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline. The net loss in earnings of equity method investment was $11.3 million, $0.2 million and $4.1 million, net of tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The fiscal 2020 loss was primarily a result of the impairment of two of the OCV Fund’s investments as a result of COVID-19 in the amount of $7.0 million, net of tax benefit. In addition, the Company recognized an investment loss in fiscal 2020 in the amount of $4.3 million, net of tax benefit. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company recognized management fees of $3.0 million, $3.0 million and $4.5 million, net of tax benefit, respectively. Digital Media and Cloud Services Results Our businesses are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance and have been aggregated into two businesses: (i) Digital Media; and (ii) Cloud Services. We evaluate the performance of our businesses based on revenues, including both external and interbusiness net sales, and operating income. We account for interbusiness sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the businesses. Identifiable assets by business are those assets used in the respective businesses operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant interbusiness amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results. -58- Digital Media The following results are presented for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Net sales of $811.4 million in 2020 increased $100.8 million, or 14.2%, and net sales of $710.5 million in 2019 increased $101.1 million, or 16.6%, from the prior comparable period primarily due to business acquisitions subsequent to the prior comparable periods. Gross profit of $733.9 million in 2020 increased $116.4 million and gross profit of $617.5 million in 2019 increased $87.0 million from the prior comparable periods primarily due to an increase in net sales between the periods. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in 2020 and 2019 was higher due to lower content fees, campaign fulfillment cost, other editorial and production costs. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in 2019 and 2018 was consistent with the previous comparable period. Operating expenses of $594.1 million in 2020 increased $53.9 million from the prior comparable period primarily due to additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to 2019 comprised primarily of salary and related costs including severance and an increase in marketing costs. Operating expenses of $540.2 million in 2019 increased $57.0 million from the prior comparable period primarily due to additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to 2018 comprised primarily of salary and related costs, marketing costs and changes in fair value of contingent consideration and amortization of intangible assets. As a result of these factors, operating income of $139.8 million in 2020 increased $62.5 million, or 80.9%, from 2019, and operating income of $77.3 million in 2019 increased $30.0 million, or 63.4%, from 2018. Cloud Services The following results are presented for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Net sales of $678.5 million in 2020 increased $16.6 million, or 2.5%, and net sales of $661.8 million in 2019 increased $63.9 million, or 10.7%, from the prior comparable period primarily due to business acquisitions. Gross profit of $524.2 million in 2020 increased $6.6 million from 2019 and gross profit of $517.6 million in 2019 increased $41.7 million from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions between the periods. The gross profit as a percentage of revenues for 2020 and 2019 was consistent with the previous comparable period. -59- Operating expenses of $275.0 million in 2020 increased $5.0 million from 2019 and was consistent with the previous comparable period. Operating expenses of $270.0 million in 2019 increased $30.4 million from 2018 primarily due to (a) additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the prior comparable period; and (b) an increase in marketing costs and amortization of intangible assets. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $249.2 million in 2020 increased $1.7 million, or 0.7%, from 2019, and operating earnings of $247.5 million in 2019 increased $11.3 million, or 4.8%, from 2018. Our Cloud Services business consists of several services which have similar economic characteristics, including the nature of the services and their production processes, the type of customers, as well as the methods used to distribute these services. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments At December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $340.8 million compared to $675.7 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments resulted primarily from the repayment of debt, business acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, purchases of property and equipment and investments; partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of debt, cash provided from operations and proceeds from the sale of businesses. At December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $242.7 million, short-term investments of $0.7 million, and long-term investments of $97.5 million. Our investments consist of equity and debt securities. For financial statement presentation, we classify our debt securities primarily as short- and long-term based upon their maturity dates. Short-term investments mature within one year of the date of the financial statements and long-term investments mature one year or more from the date of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 cash, cash equivalents, and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $240.5 million and $100.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 cash, cash equivalents, and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $604.7 million and $71.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately $259.7 million primarily due to cash outflows of $662.9 million related to business combinations and share repurchases during the second half of 2020. In addition, the 3.25% Convertible Notes in the amount of $396.8 million are recorded as a current liability as of December 31, 2020 due to the Holders right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their 3.25% Convertible Notes on June 15, 2021. However, due to the fact that the Convertible Notes are trading well above par, management has determined that the likelihood that the Holders will exercise this right is remote. On October 7, 2020, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2030. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the redemption of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.0% Senior Notes previously issued by one of our subsidiaries and to pay the redemption premium due in respect of such redemption and accrued and unpaid interest. The company expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including acquisitions. Subsequent to the year end, the Company is pursuing to reestablish a credit facility at the J2 Global, Inc. level providing borrowings of $100.0 million expandable, subject to certain conditions, to $350.0 million. The Company’s Board of Directors approved two quarterly cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2019, totaling $0.900 per share of common stock. Future dividends are subject to Board approval. However, based on the significant number of current investment opportunities within the Company’s portfolio of businesses and the historic returns from prior investments, the Board of Directors suspended dividend payments for the foreseeable future after the June 4, 2019 payment. On January 7, 2019, J2 Cloud Services, LLC entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”) and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as sole lead arranger and as administrative agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”). On October 7, 2020, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement. On November 15, 2019, the Company issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Notes and received net proceeds of $537.1 million in cash, net of initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions and other debt issuance costs. A portion of the net proceeds were used pay off all amounts then outstanding under the MUFG Credit Facility, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions. On June 10, 2014, J2 Global issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2029 (the “3.25% Convertible Notes”). During the fourth quarter of 2020, the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days -60- ending on, and including, the last trading day of the quarter. As a result, the 3.25% Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder during the quarter beginning January 1, 2021 and ending March 31, 2021. Since the Company currently intends to settle the principal amount in cash, the net carrying amount of the 3.25% Convertible Notes is classified within current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020. On September 25, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company’s entry into a commitment to invest $200 million in an investment fund (the “Fund”) over several years at a fairly ratable rate. The manager, OCV Management, LLC (“OCV”), and general partner of the Fund are entities with respect to which Richard S. Ressler, Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company, is indirectly the majority equity holder. As a limited partner in the Fund, the Company will pay an annual management fee to the manager equal to 2.0% (reduced by 10% each year beginning with the sixth year) of capital commitments. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Fund’s limited partnership agreement, once the Company has received distributions equal to its invested capital, the Fund’s general partner will be entitled to a carried interest equal to 20%. The Fund has a six year investment period, subject to certain exceptions. The commitment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board in accordance with the Company’s related-party transaction approval policy. During 2020, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC for $32.9 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which $31.9 million has been paid for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, the Company received a distribution from OCV of $10.3 million. During 2019, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC for $29.6 million inclusive of certain management fees, of which $29.6 million has been paid for the year ended December 31, 2019. We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditure, investment requirements, stock repurchases and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. Cash Flows Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $480.1 million, $412.5 million and $401.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, increased income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, higher tax payments, lower uncertain tax positions and reduced deferred revenue. Our prepaid tax payments were $3.0 million and $3.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $243.3 million, $575.6 million and $209.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was $586.2 million, $505.3 million and $406.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of equity method investments; partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of businesses. Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and purchases of equity method investments; partially offset by the distribution from an equity method investment. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(234.6) million, $456.7 million and $(131.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 was primarily attributable to the repayment of debt, repurchase of stock and business acquisitions; partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our 4.625% Senior Notes and exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of 1.75% Convertible Notes, proceeds from the line of credit and exercise of stock options; partially offset by payment of the line of credit, dividends paid, repurchase of stock, business acquisitions and repayment of note payable. -61- Stock Repurchase Program In February 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock through February 20, 2013 which was subsequently extended through February 20, 2021. In July 2016, the Company acquired and subsequently retired 935,231 shares of J2 Global common stock in connection with the acquisition of Integrated Global Concepts, Inc. As a result of the purchase of J2 Global common stock, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a reduction in the number of shares available for purchase under the 2012 Program by the same amount. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 1,140,819 and 197,870 shares under this program, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all of the available shares were repurchased under the 2012 Program at an aggregate cost of $204.6 million (including an immaterial amount of commission fees). On August 6, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock through August 6, 2025 (the “2020 Program”) in addition to the five million shares repurchased under the 2012 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2,490,599 shares at an aggregate cost of $177.8 million (including an immaterial amount of commission fees) under the 2020 Program, which were subsequently retired. As a result of the Company’s share repurchase programs, the number of shares available for purchase is 7,509,401 shares of J2 Global common stock. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020: (a) These amounts represent principal on long-term debt. (b) These amounts represent interest on long-term debt. (c) These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases.

(i) These amounts primarily represent certain consulting and Board of Director fee arrangements, software license commitments and others. As of December 31, 2020, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $57.1 million. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities. -62- We have not presented contingent consideration associated with acquisitions in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and the timing of cash settlements. We have also not presented our remaining commitment to OCV Management, LLC of approximately $94.5 million due to the uncertainty of timing of funding requests. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.",
1721947,"Business — The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects” for additional information. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to: Attract new customers. Our ability to attract new customers is dependent upon a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our pricing and solutions, the features and pricing of our competitors' offerings, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the effectiveness of our channel partners in selling, marketing and deploying our software solutions and the growth of the market for Apple devices and services for SMBs and enterprises. Sustaining our growth requires continued adoption of our platform by new customers. We intend to continue to invest in building brand awareness as we further penetrate our addressable markets. We intend to expand our customer base by continuing to make significant and targeted investments in our direct sales and marketing to attract new customers and to drive broader awareness of our software solutions. Expand within our customer base. Our ability to increase revenue within our existing customer base is dependent upon a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our software solutions and support, the features and pricing of our competitors’ offerings and our ability to effectively enhance our platform by developing new products and features and addressing additional use cases. Often our customers will begin with a small deployment and then later expand their usage more broadly within the enterprise as they realize the benefits of our platform. We believe that our “land and expand” business model allows us to efficiently increase revenue from our existing customer base. We intend to continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our software solutions, creating additional use cases, and developing more products, features, and functionality, which we believe are important factors to expand usage of our software solutions by our existing customer base. We believe our ability to retain and expand usage of our software solutions by our existing customer base is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate. Sustain product innovation and technology leadership. Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain product innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We believe that we have built a highly differentiated platform and we intend to further extend the adoption of our platform through additional innovation. While sales of subscriptions to our Jamf Pro product account for most of our revenue, we intend to continue to invest in building additional products, features and functionality that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new use cases. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop, market and sell additional products to both new and existing customers. For example, in 2018, we introduced Jamf Connect to provide users with a seamless connection to corporate resources using a single identity and in 2019 we introduced Jamf Protect to extend Apple's security and privacy model to enterprise teams by creating unprecedented visibility into MacOS fleets through customized remote monitoring and threat detection and prevention. Continue investment in growth. Our ability to effectively invest for growth is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to offset anticipated increases in operating expenses with revenue growth, our ability to spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling innovation and technologies, our ability to accurately predict costs and our ability to maintain our corporate culture as our headcount expands. We plan to continue investing in our business so we can capitalize on our market opportunity. We intend to grow our sales team to target expansion within our midmarket and enterprise customers and to attract new customers. We expect to continue to make focused investments in marketing to drive brand awareness and enhance the effectiveness of our customer acquisition model. We also intend to continue to add headcount to our research and development team to develop new and improved products, features and functionality. Although these investments may increase our operating expenses and, as a result, adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe they will contribute to our long-term growth. Continue international expansion. Our international growth in any region will depend on our ability to effectively implement our business processes and go-to-market strategy, our ability to adapt to market or cultural differences, the general competitive landscape, our ability to invest in our sales and marketing channels, the maturity and 72 growth trajectory of Apple devices and services by region and our brand awareness and perception. We plan to continue making investments in our international sales and marketing channels to take advantage of this market opportunity while refining our go-to-market approach based on local market dynamics. While we believe global demand for our platform will increase as international market awareness of Jamf grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems (including with respect to data transfer and privacy), alternative dispute systems and commercial markets. In addition, global demand for our platform and the growth of our international operations is dependent upon the rate of market adoption of Apple products in international markets. Enhance our offerings via our partner network. Our success is dependent not only on our independent efforts to innovate, scale and reach more customers directly but also on the success of our partners to continue to gain share in the enterprise. With a focus on the user and being the bridge between critical technologies — with Apple and Microsoft as two examples — we feel we can help other market participants deliver more to enterprise users with the power of Jamf. We will continue to invest in the relationships with our existing, critical partners, nurture and develop new relationships and do so globally. We will continue to invest in developing “plus one” solutions and workflows that help tie our software solutions together with those delivered by others. Key Business Metrics In addition to our GAAP financial information, we review several operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. Number of Devices We believe our ability to grow the number of devices on our software platform provides a key indicator of the growth of our business and our future business opportunities. We define a device at the end of any particular period as a device owned by a customer, which device has at least one Jamf product pursuant to an active subscription or support and maintenance agreement or that has a reasonable probability of renewal. We define a customer at the end of any particular period as an entity with at least one active subscription or support and maintenance agreement as of the measurement date or that has a reasonable probability of renewal. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments or divisions that use our platform may represent multiple customers as we treat each entity, subsidiary, segment or division that is invoiced separately as a single customer. In cases where customers subscribe to our platform through our channel partners, each end customer is counted separately. A single customer may have multiple Jamf products on a single device, but we still would only count that as one device. The number of devices was 20.4 million and 15.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a 29% year-over-year growth rate. We have seen particular strength in the growth rate of devices as COVID-19 has accelerated the demand for organizations to connect remotely, manage, and protect their Apple devices. Annual Recurring Revenue Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) represents the annualized value of all subscription and support and maintenance contracts as of the end of the period. ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term and the sales mix of subscriptions for term-based licenses and SaaS. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. Our ARR was $285.3 million and $208.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is an increase of 37% year-over-year. The growth in our ARR is primarily driven by our high device expansion rates, our new logo acquisition and the upselling and cross selling of products into our installed base. 73 Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate To further illustrate the “land and expand” economics of our customer relationships, we examine the rate at which our customers increase their subscriptions for our software solutions. Our dollar-based net retention rate measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expanded use of our software solutions, offset by customers whose subscription contracts with us are not renewed or renew at a lower amount. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rates were 117% and 118% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our high dollar-based net retention rates are primarily attributable to an expansion of devices. We believe our ability to cross-sell our new solutions to our installed base, particularly Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect, will continue to support our high dollar-based net retention rates. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures of Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Income, Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP Gross Profit Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to gross profit or gross profit margin, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin as Non-GAAP Gross Profit as a percentage of total revenue. We use Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. We believe Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin are useful measures to us and to our investors to assist in evaluating our core operating performance because it provides consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metric eliminates the effects of variability of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired developed technology, which are non-cash expenses that may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. While the amortization expense of acquired developed technology is excluded from Non-GAAP Gross Profit, the revenue related to acquired developed technology is reflected in Non-GAAP Gross Profit as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin should not be considered as 74 replacements for gross profit or gross profit margin, as determined by GAAP, or as measures of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP Gross Profit to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows: ​ Non-GAAP Operating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to operating loss or operating loss margin, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Operating Income as operating loss, adjusted for amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expense, acquisition-related earnout and costs associated with our secondary offering. We define Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin as Non-GAAP Operating Income as a percentage of total revenue. We use Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin facilitate comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense of acquired trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology is excluded from Non-GAAP Operating Income, the revenue related to acquired trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology is reflected in Non-GAAP Operating Income as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin should not be considered as replacements for operating loss or operating loss margin, as determined by GAAP, or as measures of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. 75 A reconciliation of Non-GAAP Operating Income to operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows: ​ Non-GAAP Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net loss, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net loss, adjusted for amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction loss, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expense, acquisition-related earnout, costs associated with our secondary offering, discrete tax items and benefit for income taxes. We use Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) facilitates comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, helps provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense of acquired trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology is excluded from Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), the revenue related to acquired trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology is reflected in Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) should not be considered as a replacement for net loss, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. 76 A reconciliation of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows: ​ (1) With exception of the fourth quarter of 2020, the related tax effects of the adjustments to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for applicable jurisdictions, which was not materially different from our annual effective tax rate of approximately 25%. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our annual effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance and foreign currencies. Therefore, we used the annual effective tax rate of 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 as this was materially different than our statutory rate. ​ Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net loss, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for interest expense, net, benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction loss, loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expense, acquisition-related earnout, and costs associated with our secondary offering. We use Adjusted EBITDA to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, helps provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a replacement for net loss, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. 77 A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows: ​ Components of Results of Operations Revenues We recognize revenue under ASC 606 when or as performance obligations are satisfied. We derive revenue primarily from sales of SaaS subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts, and to a lesser extent, sales of on-premise subscriptions and perpetual licenses and services. Subscription. Subscription revenue consists of sales of SaaS subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts. We sell our software solutions primarily with a one-year contract term. We typically invoice SaaS subscription fees and support and maintenance fees annually in advance and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified the license portion of on-premise subscription revenue from license revenue to subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations on a retroactive basis. See additional information in “Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Description of Business” to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The license portion of on-premise subscription revenue is recognized upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. See “Critical Accounting Policies” for more information. We expect subscription revenue to increase over time as we expand our customer base because sales to new customers are expected to be primarily SaaS subscriptions. License. License revenue consists of revenue from on-premise perpetual licenses of our Jamf Pro product sold primarily to existing customers. We recognize license revenue upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We expect license revenue to decrease because sales to new customers are primarily cloud-based subscription arrangements and therefore reflected in subscription revenue. Services. Services revenues consist primarily of professional services provided to our customers to configure and optimize the use of our software solutions, as well as training services related to the operation of our software solutions. Our services are priced on a fixed fee basis and generally invoiced in advance of the service being delivered. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed. We expect services revenues to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as the demand for our services is not expected to grow at the same rate as the demand for our subscription solutions. 78 Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription and support and maintenance arrangements, our customer success function, and third-party hosting fees related to our cloud services. Employee compensation and related costs include cash compensation and benefits to employees and associated overhead costs. We expect cost of subscription revenue to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of subscription revenue, relative to the extent of the growth of our business. Cost of services. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs directly associated with delivery of professional services and training, costs of third-party integrators and other associated overhead costs. We expect cost of services revenue to decrease in absolute dollars relative to the decrease of our services business. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of cloud-based subscription customers, the costs associated with supporting our cloud solution, the extent to which we expand our customer support team and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology and infrastructure though technological improvements. We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars. We expect our gross margin to increase over time as compared to the rates we delivered prior to the impact of COVID, as subscription revenue becomes a larger proportion of revenue, and as we increase average ARR per device. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our sales force are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit, which is estimated to be 5 years. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we expand our sales personnel and marketing efforts. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and allocated overhead. We will continue to invest in innovation so that we can offer our customers new solutions and enhance our existing solutions. See “Business — Research and Development” for more information. We expect such investment to increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, facilities, accounting and finance, legal and compliance, and information technology departments. In addition, general and administrative expenses include acquisition-related expenses which primarily consist of third-party expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, and adjustments to contingent consideration. General and administrative expenses also include costs incurred in secondary offerings. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase on a dollar basis as our business grows, particularly as we continue to invest in technology infrastructure and expand our operations globally. Also, we incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations and accounting expenses. Amortization. Amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of acquired trademarks, customer relationships and developed technology. 79 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities as well as the amortization of associated deferred financing costs. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Facilities.” Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Upon closing of the IPO, we repaid $205.0 million of the principal amount of the Prior Term Loan Facility and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.2 million for the prepayment penalty and write off of debt issuance costs. Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of all our international operations is the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are remeasured in accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters . Remeasurement adjustments are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit consists primarily of income taxes related to U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Other Income Other income consists primarily of sublease rental income. The sublease was terminated in the second quarter of 2020. 80 Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated: ​ ​ ​ 81 ​ ​ General and administrative also includes a Digita earnout benefit (expense) of $1.0 million and $(0.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 82 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated: ​ ​ Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 Revenue ​ ​ Total revenue increased by $65.4 million, or 32%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Overall revenue increased as a result of higher subscription revenue, partially offset by lower services and license revenue. Subscription revenue accounted for 93% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 86% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by device expansion, the addition of new customers and cross-selling. Services revenue has decreased as COVID-19 83 impacted our in-person trainings, and our product enhancements have reduced customer reliance on our services in order to utilize our products. License revenue decreased as a result of shifting customers to our SaaS model as opposed to on-premise perpetual licenses. Total revenue increased by $57.5 million, or 39%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Overall revenue increased as a result of higher subscription revenue partially offset by slightly lower services and license revenue. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by the addition of new customers as well as an increase in device expansion within our installed customer base. Services revenue has decreased as our product enhancements have reduced the reliance our customers need to place on our services in order to utilize our products. License revenue decreased as a result of shifting customers to our SaaS model as opposed to on-premise perpetual licenses. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin ​ ​ Cost of revenue increased by $4.8 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 driven by an increase in cost of subscription revenue and amortization expense, partially offset by lower services cost of revenue. Cost of subscription revenue increased $7.8 million primarily due to an increase of $4.1 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount to support the growth in our subscription customer base, an increase of $2.4 million in third party hosting fees as we increased capacity to support our growth, an increase of $0.9 million in computer hardware and software costs to support the growth of the business and a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Amortization expense increased $0.5 million due to intangibles added to our balance sheet as the result of acquisitions. Cost of services revenue decreased $3.5 million as a result of lower services revenue. Cost of revenue increased by $6.7 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by an increase in cost of subscription revenue and amortization expense partially offset by lower services cost of revenue. Cost of subscription revenue increased $7.5 million due to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount to support the growth in our subscription customer base, an increase of $2.4 million in third party hosting fees as we increased capacity to support our growth and an increase of $1.5 million in costs to support the growth of the business. Amortization expense increased $1.3 million due to intangibles added to our balance sheet as the result of acquisitions. Cost of services revenue decreased $2.0 million due to deploying more cost effective delivery of services, which includes the use of third-party integrators. Total gross margin was 77%, 73% and 66% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as our revenue expanded faster than the costs required to deliver the revenue. 84 Operating Expenses ​ ​ Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $25.2 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $17.8 million in employee compensation costs driven by headcount growth, a $5.1 million increase in marketing costs, an increase of $2.8 million in computer hardware and software costs to support the growth of the business and a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting the IPO grant, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in travel-related expenses reflecting less travel due to COVID-19. Marketing costs increased primarily due to increases in demand generation programs, advertising, and brand awareness campaigns focused on new customer acquisition, as well as an increase in costs related to our annual user conference. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $19.0 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.2 million in employee compensation costs related to headcount growth. Marketing costs increased by $2.8 million primarily due to increases in demand generation programs, advertising and brand awareness campaigns focused on new customer acquisition. The remainder of the cost increase related to costs to support the growth in business and headcount of approximately $3.0 million. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by $9.6 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $6.7 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, an increase of $1.1 million in outside services, an increase of $1.3 million in computer hardware and software costs to support the growth of the business and a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting the IPO grant, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in travel-related expenses reflecting less travel due to COVID-19. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by $11.3 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $8.8 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and an increase of $0.8 million in computer hardware and software costs to support the growth of the business. The remainder of the cost increase related to costs to support the growth in business and headcount of approximately $1.7 million. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $19.9 million, or 62%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $6.3 million in employee compensation costs driven by higher headcount to support our continued growth, $6.1 million in additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, a $5.2 million increase in acquisition-related expenses, a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $0.8 million increase in allowance for bad debt and returns, partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction to contingent consideration. The remainder of the cost increase is primarily related to costs to support the growth in business and headcount. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $9.7 million, or 44%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.5 million in employee compensation costs primarily related to higher headcount to support our continued growth and an increase of $3.0 million in costs of professional services comprised primarily of legal and accounting fees driven by the 2019 acquisitions of ZuluDesk and Digita and general growth in the Company. In addition, charitable 85 contributions increased by $0.9 million. The remainder of the cost increase related to costs to support the growth in business and headcount of approximately $2.3 million. Amortization Expense. Amortization expense increased by $0.2 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 20120 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to additional intangibles that were acquired in 2020 and July 2019. Amortization Expense. Amortization expense increased by $0.9 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to additional intangibles that were acquired in 2019. Interest Expense, Net ​ ​ Interest expense, net decreased by $10.7 million, or 50%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflecting the repayment of the Prior Term Loan Facility, as well as a lower interest rate prior to repayment. Interest expense, net increased by $3.2 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the additional borrowing of $30.0 million under the Prior Term Loan Facility in 2019 to fund the acquisition of ZuluDesk, partially offset by a lower interest rate in 2019 compared to 2018. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt ​ ​ Loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of a prepayment penalty of $2.0 million and write off of debt issuance costs of $3.2 million in connection with the early repayment of the Prior Term Loan Facility. Foreign Currency Transaction Loss ​ ​ Foreign currency transaction loss decreased by $0.5 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the loss was driven by a favorable impact from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Euros and Australian dollars compared to the prior year. Foreign currency transaction loss increased by $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the loss was driven primarily by the weakening of the U.S. dollar 86 relative to the Euro on significant Euro denominated intercompany loans that were utilized to fund the acquisition of ZuluDesk. Other Income, Net ​ ​ Other income, net decreased by $0.1 million, or 59%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Other income, net was due to the termination of our sublease in the second quarter of 2020. Income Tax Benefit ​ ​ Income tax benefit was $8.3 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 26.7% and 23.7%, respectively. The key components of the Company’s income tax benefit primarily consist of state and federal income taxes, federal research and development credits, valuation allowances and stock compensation. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than the prior year due to the impact of stock compensation, the net operating loss carryback and interest limitation changes related to the CARES Act, research and development credits, the final GILTI high-tax exclusion regulation released on July 20, 2020 and a change in valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets related to a merger of subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by $2.9 million of discrete income tax benefit primarily related to the loss on debt extinguishment, stock compensation, and the impact of the net operating loss carryback and interest limitation changes related to the CARES Act. Income tax benefit was $10.1 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 23.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The key components of the Company’s income tax benefit primarily consist of state and federal income taxes, federal research and development credits and GILTI provisions. The effective rate in 2019 was lower than 2018 due to higher permanent differences and a valuation allowance for foreign deferred tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources General As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $194.9 million, which were held for working capital purposes, as well as the available balance of our New Revolving Credit Facility, described further below. Our cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds and U.S. Treasuries with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. Our positive cash flows from operations enable us to make continued investments in supporting the growth of our business. We expect that our operating cash flows, in addition to our cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to continue to make such investments in the future. On July 24, 2020, we closed our IPO through which we issued and sold 13,500,000 shares of common stock at the IPO Price. In connection with the IPO, we raised approximately $319.0 million, after deducting the underwriting 87 discount and offering expenses payable by us. Concurrently with our IPO, we issued and sold 85,880 shares of our common stock in a private placement to certain of our named executive officers, certain of our other employees and our independent directors at the IPO Price for aggregate consideration of approximately $2.2 million. Upon closing of the IPO, the Company repaid $205.0 million of the principal amount of the Prior Term Loan Facility and paid $3.4 million of accrued interest and $2.0 million of prepayment penalty. The Company also wrote off $3.2 million of remaining debt issuance costs upon repayment of the debt. The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $5.2 million for the prepayment penalty and write off of debt issuance costs in the third quarter of 2020. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our New Revolving Credit Facility and cash provided by sales of our software solutions and services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the future, we may use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We are a holding company and we derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow is dependent on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability of those entities to distribute funds to us. See Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Dividend Policy ” for a discussion of our dividend policy, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and distributions to us. A majority of our customers pay in advance for subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts, a portion of which is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is later recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred revenue of $206.0 million, of which $160.5 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Credit Facilities On November 13, 2017, we entered into the Prior Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, comprised of the $175.0 million Prior Term Loan Facility and the $15.0 million Prior Revolving Credit Facility, in each case with a maturity date of November 13, 2022. Pursuant to the Amendment Agreement No. 1, dated as of January 30, 2019, the Prior Term Loan Facility was increased to $205.0 million. Upon closing of the IPO, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance of the Prior Term Loan Facility, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated. On July 27, 2020, we entered into the New Credit Agreement, which provides for an initial revolving credit facility of $150.0 million, and which amount may be increased or decreased under specific circumstances, with a $25.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $50.0 million alternative currency sublimit. In addition, the New Credit Agreement provides for the ability of the Company to request incremental term loan facilities, in a minimum amount of $5.0 million for each facility. The maturity date of the New Credit Agreement is July 27, 2025. The New Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, reporting obligations, negative covenants and events of default. We were in compliance with such covenants as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under our New Revolving Credit Facility. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded debt issuance costs of $1.3 million, which is amortized to interest expense over the term of the New Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, debt issuance costs of $1.1 million are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The interest rates applicable to revolving borrowings under the New Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, either (i) a base rate, which is equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (subject to a floor) for a one month interest period (each term as defined in the 88 New Credit Agreement) plus 1%, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (subject to a floor) equal to the LIBO Rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate, plus in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate (i) for base rate loans range from 0.25% to 1.0% per annum and (ii) for LIBO Rate loans range from 1.25% to 2.0% per annum, in each case, based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the New Credit Agreement). Base rate borrowings may only be made in dollars. The Company pays a commitment fee during the term of the New Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of the revolving commitments based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: ​ ​ Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $52.7 million reflecting our net loss of $22.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $51.6 million and net cash inflows of $23.9 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, amortization of deferred contract costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, provision for bad debt expense and returns, loss on extinguishment of debt and share-based compensation, partially offset by deferred taxes and a $1.0 million adjustment to our Digita earnout. The primary drivers of net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $65.1 million increase in deferred revenue, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $9.4 million and an increase in other liabilities of $1.9 million, partially offset by a $24.6 million increase in deferred contract costs, a $23.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.9 million reflecting our net loss of $32.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $35.8 million and net cash inflows of $8.7 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, amortization of deferred contract costs, amortization of debt issuance costs and share-based compensation, partially offset by deferred taxes. The primary drivers of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $37.0 million increase in deferred revenue and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.5 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of $14.7 million, deferred contract costs of $17.0 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 million, reflecting our net loss of $36.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $27.7 million and net cash inflows of $18.0 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, and amortization of deferred contract costs partially offset by deferred taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and 89 liabilities related to a $32.5 million increase in deferred revenue partially offset by a $13.2 million increase in deferred contract costs. Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $6.9 million driven by purchases of $4.4 million in equipment and leasehold improvements to support our higher headcount with additional office space and hardware and software and the acquisition of Mondada of $2.5 million, net of cash acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $47.4 million driven by the acquisition of ZuluDesk and Digita of $40.2 million, net of cash acquired, and purchases of $7.2 million in equipment and leasehold improvements to support our higher headcount with additional office space and hardware and software. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $5.8 million primarily driven by the acquisition of Orchard &amp; Grove for $2.1 million in cash and purchases of $2.9 million in equipment and leasehold improvements to support higher headcount and additional office space and hardware and software. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities of $116.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to proceeds of $326.3 million from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, $3.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $2.2 million of proceeds from the private placement, partially offset by the repayment of $205.0 million principal amount of our Prior Term Loan Facility, the payment of debt extinguishment costs of $2.0 million, the payment of offering costs of $7.3 million and the payment of debt issuance costs of $1.3 million related to the New Credit Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities of $28.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increased borrowings on our Prior Credit Facilities of $40.0 million for the ZuluDesk acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition, we repaid $10.0 million of our Prior Credit Facilities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of December 31, 2020, our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and noncancelable minimum annual commitments with AWS for hosting services and other vendors for support software. The following table sets forth the amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms as of December 31, 2020: ​ (1) Other obligations represent a noncancelable minimum annual commitment with AWS for hosting services and other support software. 90 The table above does not include potential earn-out consideration payable in connection with our 2019 acquisition of Digita. In connection with that acquisition, we agreed to an earn-out arrangement providing for up to $15.0 million payable to the seller, subject to meeting certain conditions. Indemnification Agreements In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, channel partners, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation claims made by third parties. See “Risk Factors — We have indemnity provisions under our contracts with our customers, channel partners and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.” In addition, in connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain executive officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows. JOBS Act We qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of SOX, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below are the most difficult management decisions as they involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions as described above. Refer to “Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information regarding our critical accounting policies. 91 Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sales of software licenses and maintenance, hosted software and related professional services. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, which provides a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as follows: Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the contract transaction price is allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) basis to each performance obligation. The Company typically determines SSP based on observable selling prices of its products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as with software licenses that are never sold on a stand-alone basis, SSP is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In addition, for software products where the pricing is also determined to be highly variable or highly uncertain, SSP is established using the residual approach. However, the Company does not currently use the residual approach for any of its performance obligations, as pricing was not determined to be highly variable or highly uncertain. SSP is typically established as ranges and the Company typically has more than one SSP range for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer class, channel type and purchase quantity, among other circumstances. Stock-Based Compensation The Company applies the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) in its accounting and reporting for stock-based compensation. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. All service-based options outstanding under the Company’s option plans have exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date, as determined by an independent third party. The fair value of these options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense for service-based options and RSUs is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period. Forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The Company also grants performance-based awards to certain executives that vest and become exercisable when Vista’s realized cash return on its investment in the Company equals or exceeds $1.515 billion upon a change in control of the Company (“Termination Event”). The terms of the agreement do not specify a performance period for the occurrence of the Termination Event. The contractual term of the awards is 10 years. These options are also referred to as return target options. The Company uses a Modified Black-Scholes option pricing model which uses Level 3 inputs for fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the vesting conditions for these options had not been met, and accordingly, no compensation expense was recorded. In conjunction with the IPO, the vesting conditions of these options were modified to also vest following an IPO and registration and sale of shares by Vista provided that Vista achieves a cash return on its equity investment in the 92 Company equaling or exceeding $1.515 billion. In accordance with ASC 718, we calculated the fair value of these options on the modification date. The value of these options on the date of modification was $33.0 million. As the awards are not currently considered probable of meeting vesting requirements no expense has been recognized, and the timing of any future expense recognition is unknown. Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, including those regarding our future expected revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable public companies and the probability of future events. Common Stock Valuation Prior to the IPO, our Board established the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards. These estimates were based in part upon valuations provided by third-party valuation firms. Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to the IPO, our Board exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the “AICPA Guide”). The factors considered by our Board in estimating the fair value of our common stock prior to the IPO included the following: In valuing our common stock prior to the IPO, our Board determined the value using both the income and the market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). To derive our WACC, a cost of equity was developed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and comparable company betas, and a cost of debt was determined based on our estimated cost of borrowing. The costs of debt and equity were then weighted based on our actual capital structure. The market approach estimates value based on an estimate of IPO value or a comparison of our company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple was determined and subsequently applied to our financial results to estimate our enterprise value. Also, our market approach factored in multiples on recent acquisitions in our industry. Application of these approaches involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, including those regarding our future expected revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable public companies and the probability of future events. Changes in any or 93 all of these estimates and assumptions would impact our valuations at each valuation date and could have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock. Following the completion of our IPO, it is no longer necessary to determine the fair value of our common stock as our shares are traded in the public market. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using currently enacted tax rates. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances. The realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating future taxable income and the reversal of existing temporary differences. Changes in tax laws and assumptions with respect to future taxable income could result in adjustment to these allowances. The Company recognizes a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions only if the Company believes it is more likely than not that the position will be upheld on audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions after the consideration of all available information. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , which requires goodwill to be either qualitatively or quantitatively assessed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for each reporting unit. The Company has one reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year and in interim periods if events occur that would indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than carrying value. If the Company’s reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment charge will be recorded based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill currently recognized in the Company’s single reporting unit. There is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows, which can have a material impact on the amount of any potential impairment. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write-down of the asset in a future period. Other Intangibles, Net Other intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology and trademarks acquired in our previous acquisitions, have definite lives, and are amortized over a period ranging from two to twelve years on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value of its fair value. There is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows, which can have a material impact on the amount of any potential impairment. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write-down of the asset in a future period.

Mergers Termination On June 20, 2019, Inuvo entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Termination Agreement (the “Merger Termination Agreement”) with ConversionPoint Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CPT”), ConversionPoint Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), CPT Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (“CPT Merger Sub”), and CPT Cigar Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Inuvo Merger Sub”), which, among other things, (1) terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 2, 2018, by and among Inuvo, CPT, Parent, CPT Merger Sub, and Inuvo Merger Sub, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Inuvo would have merged with and into Inuvo Merger Sub and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and CPT would have merged with and into CPT Merger Sub and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Mergers”), and (2) terminated each of the Support Agreements that were entered into by certain officers and directors of Inuvo and the parties to the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement was terminated as a result of Parent’s inability to fulfill the closing condition of the Mergers that Parent raise $36,000,000 in gross proceeds from an equity, debt, or equity-linked offering of its securities which no longer obligated Inuvo to consummate the Mergers contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Termination Agreement, CPT Investments, LLC, a California limited liability company and an affiliate of CPT (“CPT Investments”), and Inuvo entered into a certain Inuvo Note Termination Agreement (the “Note Termination Agreement”) and agreed to (1) terminate and cancel the 10% Senior Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note, dated November 1, 2018, executed by Inuvo in favor of CPT Investments (the “CPTI Note”), which as of June 20, 2019, had $1,063,288 in accrued principal and interest outstanding (the “Outstanding Indebtedness”) by July 20, 2019, (2) effective immediately, terminate all conversion rights under the CPTI Note to convert amounts outstanding into shares of Inuvo’s common stock, (3) terminate the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated November 1, 2018, by and between Inuvo and CPT Investments (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), and (4) terminate the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 1, 2018, by and between Inuvo and CPT Investments. The Merger Termination Agreement provided that the termination fee of $2,800,000 to be paid to Inuvo (the “Termination Fee”) for failure to fulfill the Financing Condition would be satisfied as follows: (1) $1,063,288 of the Termination Fee was satisfied in consideration of the termination and cancellation of the Outstanding Indebtedness pursuant to the CPTI Note Termination Agreement that was approved by CPT’s senior lenders Montage Capital II, L.P. and Partners for Growth IV, L.P. and CPT’s issuance of a replacement note to CPT Investments that was entered into in July 2019; (2) $1,611,712 of the Termination Fee was satisfied by CPT transferring all of the assets related to CPT’s programmatic and RTB advertising solutions business conducted through managed services and a proprietary SaaS solution (the “ReTargeter Business”), free and clear of all liabilities, encumbrances, or liens, to Inuvo; and (3) CPT paid $125,000 to Inuvo on September 15, 2019 to be contributed to the settlement of ongoing litigation with respect to the Mergers. On September 30, 2019, Inuvo paid its obligation of $250,000 under a confidential settlement agreement that it entered into on June 20, 2019 resolving certain outstanding litigation related to the Mergers. Under the Merger Termination Agreement, CPT and Inuvo agreed to mutually release all claims that each party had against the other, as well as certain affiliated entities of each. Inuvo, however, will be able to pursue any claims against CPT and its affiliates for breaches of the Merger Termination Agreement. An independent valuation of the ReTargeter Business was completed as of September 30, 2019. The enterprise valuation of the ReTargeter Business was determined to be $2.57 million. Hitachi Credit Agreement On March 12, 2020 Inuvo, Inc. closed a Loan and Security Agreement dated February 28, 2020 by and between our Company and our subsidiaries and Hitachi. Under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement Hitachi has provided us with a $5,000,000 line of credit commitment. We are permitted to borrow (i) 90% of the aggregate Eligible Accounts Receivable, plus 14 (i) the lesser of 75% of the aggregate Unbilled Accounts Receivable (as those terms are defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) or 50% of the amount available to borrow under (i), up to the maximum credit commitment. On March 12, 2020 we drew $5,000,000 under this agreement, using $2,959,573 of these proceeds to satisfy our obligations to Western Alliance Bank under our credit agreement with it and the balance was used for working capital at the time. Following the satisfaction of our obligations to Western Alliance Bank, all agreements with that entity were terminated. We will pay Hitachi monthly interest at the rate of 2% in excess of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, with a minimum rate of 6.75% per annum, on outstanding amounts. The principal and all accrued but unpaid interest are due on demand. In the event of a default under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, the interest rate increases to 6% greater than the interest rate in effect from time to time prior to a default. The Loan and Security Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants to which we are also subject. We agreed to pay Hitachi a commitment fee of $50,000, with one half due upon the execution of the agreement and the balance due six months thereafter. Thereafter, we are obligated to pay Hitachi a commitment fee of $15,000 annually. We are also obligated to pay Hitachi a quarterly service fee of 0.30% on the monthly unused amount of the maximum credit line. In addition to a $2,000 document fee we have paid to Hitachi, if we should exit the Agreement before March 1, 2022, we are obligated to pay Hitachi an exit fee of $50,000. 2020 Overview We entered 2020 with two product lines, ValidClick and IntentKey, the latter having been launched through an integration with Xandr at the end of 2018. For ValidClick, our objective was to keep the business steady while diversifying revenue within the product line. With the termination of the Merger Agreement with CPT in June 2019, we began to reassess our strategy. The integration of the IntentKey to Xandr leading into 2019 provided a means to distribute our IntentKey product. We had conducted an extensive evaluation of potential partners in late 2018 having ultimately selected Xandr due to their scale and the immediate fit of their technology. This relationship allowed our proprietary data, which is manufactured by our patented artificial intelligence, to become available for sale by Inuvo as a service to online advertisers, thousands of which use the Xandr platform to execute their campaigns. This year, 2020, has been an extraordinary year that could not have been predicted at the time it was forecasted. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. Beginning in late April 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in demand (marketing budgets) within the ValidClick business and a modest decline in demand within the IntentKey business, the combination of which has resulted in a significant reduction in our revenue run rate. Generally, marketing budgets tend to decline in times of a recession. We curtailed expenses, including compensation and travel and we issued a work from home policy to protect our employees and their families from virus transmission between co-workers. We began to experience interruptions in our daily operations, as a result of these policies. The revenue impact on our industry could vary dramatically by vertical. For example, we experienced less advertising demand from the travel, leisure and hospitality verticals. We also maintain long-standing relationships with Yahoo! and Google that provide access to hundreds of thousands of advertisers from which most of our ValidClick and digital publishing revenue originates. We continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Company. We reported lower revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 due predominately to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer advertising budgets. Gross margins improved significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. We reported gross margins of 81.4% in 2020 compared to 63.1% in the prior year due to reducing outsourced campaign management for the ValidClick platform as well as growing acceptance of the IntentKey. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic First identified in late 2019 and known now as COVID-19, the outbreak has impacted millions of individuals and businesses worldwide. In response, many countries have implemented measures to combat the outbreak which has had an unprecedented economic consequence. We did not experience an impact from COVID-19 through the end of fiscal year 2019 and had only minor impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020. Because we operate in the digital advertising industry, unlike a brick and mortar-based company, predicting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our Company is difficult. Beginning in late April 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in marketing budgets and a decrease in monetization rates which impacted ValidClick more severely than the IntentKey. This resulted in a significant reduction in our overall revenue run rates within the year with the low point having occurred in May. 15 In response to COVID-19, we curtailed expenses, including compensation and travel throughout the year in addition to the other actions described above. Additionally, in April 2020, we obtained an unsecured Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (""CARES"") Act of $1.1 million which we used primarily for payroll costs. The loan was fully forgiven by the Small Business Administration (SBA) on November 2, 2020. Beginning mid-June 2020, we began to experience an improvement in overall daily revenue, but because of the unprecedented sustainability of COVID-19 on our business, we are unable at this time to predict with any certainty how our clients will adapt their business strategies within the context of COVID-19 and therefore how our revenue run rate will change as a result. As a result of this uncertainty, we are focusing our resources on areas we believe could have more immediate revenue potential, attempting to reduce expenses and raising additional capital so as to mitigate operating disruptions while the impact of COVID-19 abates. Our net working capital was a positive $5.9 million as of December 31, 2020. During January 2021, the Company raised approximately $14.3 million, before expenses, through the sale of our securities in two offerings. During the second and third quarters of 2020, we raised approximately $16.5 million, before expenses, through the sale of our securities and in April 2020, we obtained a $1.1 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020 (“PPP Loan”). With the reduction in our revenue run rate, there is an increased need for working capital to fund our operations. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding to continue operations, particularly in light of the current impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. capital markets, but believe we have sufficient capital to operate during the next twelve months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for 2020 and 2019 appearing elsewhere in this report. The estimates and assumptions that management makes affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management’s regular evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, valuation of long-lived assets, income tax valuation allowance and derivative liability. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and such differences could be material. Results of Operations Net Revenue We experienced lower year over year revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue declined within the ValidClick platform where COVID-19 had a material impact on advertising budgets. The renegotiation of payment terms and conditions with marketing partners in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 also contributed to the lower ValidClick revenue as a trade off for higher gross margins. The IntentKey platform grew 22.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue is primarily generated by payments to website publishers and app developers that host advertisements we serve through ValidClick and to ad exchanges that provide access to a supply of advertising inventory where we serve advertisements 16 using information predicted by the IntentKey. The decrease in the cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 was due primarily to the decline in ValidClick revenue as described in the Net Revenue section and the decision to reduce certain historically outsourced campaign management tasks. Operating Expenses Marketing costs or TAC include those expenses required to attract an audience to the ValidClick owned and operated web properties. The decrease in marketing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due primarily to the decline in revenue as described in the Net Revenue section, the decision to reduce the use of outside agencies for traffic acquisition and due to renegotiating payment terms and conditions with a ValidClick marketing partner in the second quarter. Compensation expense was higher for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 due primarily to higher employee salary expense, commissions, stock-based compensation and accrued incentive pay. Our total employment, both full and part-time, was 75 at December 31, 2020 compared to 65 at December 31, 2019. The higher head count at the end of 2020, as described above, was primarily the result of a decision to reduce the use of outside agencies for traffic acquisition and take the function in-house. Selling, general and administrative costs were lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 due primarily to approximately $1 million in legal and professional fees related to the terminated Merger in 2019. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net, which represents interest expense on financed receivables, finance lease obligations and PPP loan, was approximately $254 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense, net, was approximately $482 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher amounts were primarily due to increased borrowings from financed receivables. Other income, net Other income, net, of $997 thousand in 2020 was primarily due to the $1.1 million PPP loan being fully forgiven on November 2, 2020. The PPP loan helped fund compensation expenses. Partially offsetting the PPP loan was a $103 thousand other expense due to the change of the fair market value of the derivative liability associated with convertible promissory notes that were extinguished by May 2020. Other income, net, of $3.4 million in 2019 is due primarily to the Termination Fee of $2.8 million and the excess fair value over assets received for ReTargeter of $967 thousand (see Mergers Termination above ) , offset by approximately $191 thousand due to the change of the fair market value of the derivative liability associated with convertible promissory notes and to $255 thousand due to the conversion of a portion of the convertible promissory notes (as described in Note 7). Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in cash flows from operating activities during 2020 was a use of cash of $5,599,335 primarily due to a net loss of $7,304,569, a decrease in the accounts payable balance by $2,271,578, the benefit of $1,260,978 from a contract cancellation and $1,109,000 from the forgiveness of the PPP loan, partially offset by the decrease in the accounts receivable balance of $1,317,508 and the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities balance by $623,576. Our terms are such that we generally collect receivables prior to paying trade payables. Media sales typically have slower payment terms than the terms of related payables. 17 Our principal sources of liquidity are the sale of our common stock, our borrowings under our credit facility with Hitachi, described in Note 6, and borrowings from non-bank financial institutions (see Note 7). During March 2020 and April 2020, we raised approximately $1.5 million in gross proceeds, before expenses, through sales of our common stock and in April 2020 we received a $1.1 million PPP Loan. On June 8, 2020, we raised an additional $5.5 million in gross proceeds, before expenses, through the sale of our common stock and on July 27, 2020, we raised an additional $10.75 million in gross proceeds, before expenses, through sales of our common stock. On January 19, 2021, we raised an additional $8 million in gross proceeds, before expenses, through the sale of our common stock, and on January 22, 2021, we raised an additional $6.25 million in gross proceeds, before expenses, through sales of our common stock. We have focused our resources behind a plan to grow our AI technology, the IntentKey, where we have a technology advantage and higher margins. If we are successful in implementing our plan, we expect to return to a positive cash flow from operations. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve this objective. Though we believe our current cash position and credit facility will be sufficient to sustain operations for the next twelve months, if our plan to grow the IntentKey business is unsuccessful, we may need to fund operations through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions. In April 2020, the Company experienced a significant reduction in advertiser marketing budgets across both the ValidClick and IntentKey platforms as a direct consequence of COVID-19. These reductions continued to adversely impact overall revenue throughout the year. While COVID-19 is still present, we are at this time, unable to quantify the long-term impacts on our Company. As a result, in May 2020 and June 2020 we implemented a temporary compensation change for senior officers and certain other highly compensated employees. We also curtailed expenses, including compensation and travel for the months of May and June, and we issued a work from home policy to protect our employees and their families from virus transmission associated with co-workers. As a result of this uncertainty, we continue to focus our resources on areas we believe have immediate revenue potential while concurrently reducing expenses where necessary with an objective to minimize daily operating disruptions. On October 7, 2020, we held a Special Meeting of Stockholders for the purpose of approving and adopting the ratification and validation of the amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock that we may issue from 60,000,000 to 100,000,000. The proposal was approved. On December 16, 2020, stockholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000. Cash Flows The table below sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended 2020 and 2019: Cash Flows - Operating Net cash used in operating activities was $5,599,335 during 2020. We reported a net loss of $7,304,569, which included non-cash expenses; depreciation and amortization of $3,237,930, amortization of right of use assets $367,981 and stock-based compensation of $858,683. The change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash of $506,196 primarily due to a decrease in the accounts payable balance by $2,271,578, offset by a decrease in the accounts receivable balance by $1,317,508. Our terms are such that we generally collect receivables prior to paying trade payables. Media sales typically have slower payment terms than the terms of related payables. During 2019, cash used in operating activities was $5,338,383. We reported a net loss of $4,488,107. Additional non-cash expenses included the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of $3,422,385 and stock-based compensation expenses of $789,914. The change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash of $1,583,570. 18 Cash Flows - Investing Net cash used in investing activities was $1,185,335 and $1,194,164 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in investing activities in both years has primarily consisted of capitalized internal development costs. Cash Flows - Financing Net cash provided by financing activities was $14,302,346 during 2020 primarily from proceeds from the sale of common stock. During 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $6,676,580 primarily from proceeds from the sale of common stock and the convertible promissory notes (as described in Note 8). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.",
1301991,"Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&amp;A”) is provided in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&amp;A is organized as follows: Company Overview Business SmartMetric, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. “SmartMetric is a development stage company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric’s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card and security card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.” 21 To date, we have devoted a substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the development of our SmartMetric Card. Since our inception in 2002, we have generated no revenue from product sales and have funded our operations principally through the private sales of our equity securities. We have never been profitable and, as of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $28,878,841. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our technologies and advance them to market. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2021 was approximately $10,325 representing 20.5% of total assets. Notwithstanding our recent capital raises, based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, we expect to be able to fund our operations into the quarter beginning April 1, 2022. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending that were not anticipated or other unforeseen events. We anticipate raising additional cash through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities to continue to fund our operations and the development of our technologies. There is no assurance that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop our ongoing clinical trials, cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy. We currently do not have commitments for future funding from any source. Going Concern The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the Company has incurred recurring losses of $944,203 and $805,577 for the period ending June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and has incurred a cumulative loss of $28,878,841 since inception (December 18, 2002). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing. The Company is currently in the development stage and has spent a substantial portion of its time in the development of its technology. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations. Management believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors. These factors include the final phase of development and mass production being successful as well as product implementation and distribution. Management plans to continue its relationship with Geneva Roth Remark in order to raise capital beyond exclusively private placement stock sales. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially; however, management cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 22 Critical Accounting Policies We have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. All of the Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements: Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Research and Development Costs - Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for electronics design and engineering, software design and engineering, component sourcing, component engineering, manufacturing, product trials, compensation and consulting costs. Earnings Per Share - In accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” the basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic net loss per share excludes the dilutive effect of stock options or warrants and convertible notes. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock options and warrants. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Patent Impairment - When the carrying balance of the Company’s patent is more than what it could be sold for on the open market and/or is not recoverable through future use, the Company decreases its value. In determining whether the carrying value is not recoverable, the Company estimates the sum of the expected cash flows from the use of the patent or its possible sale. If the results in an amount less that the patent’s value on the financial statements, the Company will deem the patent’s carrying value on the balance sheet to be impaired by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the asset. The decrease in the patent’s value will then be included as a loss in the Company’s profit and loss statement. The Company had no patent asset recorded at June 30, 2021. Cash – The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Any amounts of cash in financial institutions which exceed FDIC insured limits exposes the Company to cash concentration risk. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 and 2020. 23 Result of Operations Year Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020 Our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future. We did not have revenue during the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020. We did not generate any revenues during the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020. Net loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $944,203 and $805,577, respectively, resulting from the operational activities described below. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $821,824 and $747,478 during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses is the result of the following factors. Research and Development Research and development expenses were 76,344 and $89,240 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $12,896, or 14.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in engineering costs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to engineering. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $555,480 and $468,238 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $87,242 or 18.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in consulting expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to employee compensation, legal, accounting and tax, other professional services, and general operating expenses. Officer salary were $190,000 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred losses since our inception in 2002 as a result of significant expenditures for operations and research and development and the lack of any revenue. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $28.9 million as of June 30, 2021 and anticipate that we will continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Through June 30, 2021, we have funded our operations through the private sale of our equity securities and exercise of options and warrants, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $27 million. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 were $10,325. 24 We are actively seeking sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs. To raise additional capital, we may sell shares of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or otherwise. If we are not able to raise additional cash, we may be forced to further delay, curtail, or cease development of our product candidates, or cease operations altogether. Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $567,582 and $744,003 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $135,078 in cash used during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to lower consulting and legal expenses. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $0 and $0 for years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $506,530 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $805,219 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease of $257,346 was due to decreased private placement sales. We are actively seeking sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs.",
1064722,"Corporate History GiveMePower Corporation (the “PubCo” or “Company”), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 7, 2001 to sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. GiveMePower was originally incorporated in Alberta, Canada as GiveMePower.com Inc. on April 18, 2000, to sell software and web-based services geared to businesses involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products throughout North America. Effective September 15, 2000, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name to GiveMePower Inc. The founder of the Company began the implementation of this business plan under his 100%-owned private company, Sundance Marketing International Inc. (Sundance). Sundance has been in existence since 1991 and at one time was a market leader in the distribution of survey, mapping and infrastructure design software in the Canadian marketplace. On April 15, 1999, Mr. Walton entered into a license agreement with Felix Computer Aided Technologies GmbH (Felix) for the exclusive rights to distribute FCAD software in North America. On December 20, 2000, the Company entered into a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization to undertake a reverse merger with a National Quotation Bureau public company called TelNet World Communications, Inc. (TelNet). TelNet was originally incorporated in the State of Utah on March 10, 1972 as Tropic Industries, Inc. (Tropic). Tropic became United Datacopy, Incorporated on February 24, 1987 which became Pen International, Inc. on March 21, 1994 and then TelNet World Communications, Inc. on March 4, 1998. TelNet had no operations nor any working capital when the Company entered into the reverse merger with it. GMP acquired the rights, title and interest to the domain name, givemepower.com from Sundance on February 16, 2001. In addition, Sundance agreed to assign its existing customer base to GMP and further agreed that it would terminate its license agreement with Felix immediately upon GMP securing its own agreement with Felix. GMP renegotiated the exclusive rights to co-develop, re-brand and distribute FCAD software in North America effective February 16, 2001. Effective July 5, 2001 the Company changed the name of TelNet to GiveMePower Corporation and changed the domicile from Utah to Nevada. The PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (“SEC”). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009. On December 31, 2019, PubCo sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share (“Series A Share”) for $38,000 to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. (“Goldstein”), a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60% voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC (“Alpharidge”), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100% member owner of Alpharidge. As a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control , however, following the transaction on December 31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company’s operating subsidiaries. As the result of above transaction, Alpharidge Capital LLC became the Company’s wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company. Alpharidge Capital LLC (“Alpharidge”) was formed under the laws of the State of California on August 30, 2019. Alpharidge has two distinct lines of businesses that comprise: (1) a specialty biopharmaceutical holding company focused on building portfolio of real estate investment properties and equity positions in select companies within select industries; and (2) an event-driven investment management operation that invests in equities, warrants, bonds and options of public and private companies in America and across the globe. O n September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for $3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (“CED Capital”), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company expects to assume more than 50% of another entity’s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87% voting control of Givemepower Corporation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include its wholly owned subsidiaries of Alpharidge Capital LLC. (“Alpharidge”), Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (“CED Capital”), and Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), and subsidiaries, in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (“VIE”) provisions of ASC 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. Current Business and Organization - Alpharidge The Company, through its three wholly owned subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital, LLC (“Alpharidge”), Malcom Wingate Cush Franklin LLC (“MWCF”), and Opportunity Zone Capital LLC (“OZC”), seeks to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources as follows: · Alpharidge and OZC Real estate operations – Real estate operations would consist primarily of rental real estate, affordable housing projects, opportunity zones, other property development and associated HOA activities.

The Company’s cash management policy which requires that the Company actively invests its excess cash into stocks, bonds and other securities is intended to provide the company greater levels of liquidity and current income. The Company uses proprietary trading models to capitalize on real-time market anomalies and generate ongoing income in the forms similar to hedge funds. Where necessary, the Company uses seeded entities to pursue real-time market transactions in publicly traded securities including but not limited to stocks, bonds, options, futures, forex, warrants, and other instruments. Current Business and Organization - CED Capital Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (“CED Capital”), a California limited liability company, is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services.

CBDZ engages in biopharmaceutical research and development operation with aim of identifying viable drug candidates to go into clinical trials and if successful, be submitted to the FDA for approval. BlackBank, Blockchain-Powered Fintech, Ai and ML Enabled Lending, and CryptoCurrency Deals The Company intends to actualize its banking and financial services operations goals through acquisition and management of (1) a one-to-four branch bank that is federally licensed in each jurisdiction; (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (Ai) enabled loan and insurance underwriting platform; (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems; (4) cryptocurrency transaction processing platform; and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; a combination of three of which would connects consumers, banks, institutional investors, and ensure access to the unbanked and underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United State of America. (1) BlackBank - Proposed Federally licensed one-four branch bank Jurisdictionally, GMPW intend to acquire and manage one-four branch bank in each of its relevant jurisdictional domain. Owning/controlling a bank or banks with branches across every urban/black neighborhood in the United States is not our goal. Rather we would be content to own a one-four branch bank in every relevant jurisdiction to allow us to initiate/conduct ML-Ai enabled and blockchain-powered digitized banking that is accessible to all black person and businesses across the United States. We intend to start our banking acquisition by finding targets that operates one-four branches. We intend to start with the acquisition of one-four branch bank, whose operation and back-office would be migrated unto a Blockchain-powered platform to digitize its entire banking operation to cover and serve all black persons in the United States. We believe that blockchain technology is one of the most suited platform to implement, run and manage a U.S. wide digitized banking services whose reach encompasses most black persons living in the United States. (2) Machine-Learning and Ai (AI) Enabled Lending and Insurance Underwriting Platform Once it has raised sufficient capital (proposed $10 million offering), the Company intends to launch the Company’s cloud-based machine learning and artificial intelligence lending platform. It is our believe that Machine-Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI), lending and insurance underwriting platform would enable a superior loan product with improved economics that can be shared between consumers and lenders. The proposed platform would aggregate consumer demand for high-quality loans and connects it to our soon-to-be-build network of ML-AI-enabled investors, lenders and bank partners. Consumers on the ML-AI platform would benefit from a highly automated, efficient, all-digital experience. Our prospective bank partners would benefit from access to new customers, lower fraud and loss rates, and increased automation throughout the lending process. Credit is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, and access to affordable credit is central to unlocking upward mobility and opportunity. The FICO score was invented in 1989 and remains the standard for determining who is approved for credit and at what interest rate. (Rob Kaufman, myFico Blog: The History of the FICO Score, August 2018). While FICO is rarely the only input in a lending decision, most banks use simple, rules-based systems that consider only a limited number of variables. Unfortunately, because legacy credit systems fail to properly identify and quantify risk, millions of creditworthy individuals are left out of the system, and millions more pay too much to borrow money. (Patrice Ficklin and Paul Watkins, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Blog: An Update on Credit Access and the Bureau’s First No-Action Letter, August 2019). The first generation of online lenders focused on bringing credit online. Analogous to earlier internet pioneers, these companies made shopping for and accessing credit simpler and easier for consumers and businesses. It was no longer necessary to stand in line at a bank branch, to sit across the desk from a loan officer and to wait weeks or months for a decision. These lenders enabled the emergence of personal loan products that were previously unprofitable for banks to offer. While they brought the credit process online, they inherited the decision frameworks that banks had used for decades and did not address the more rewarding and challenging opportunity of reinventing the credit decision. GMPW intend to leverage the power of AI to more accurately quantify the true risk of a loan. The ML- AI models would be built to continuously self-upgrade, train and refine many critical components of lending risk analytics and decision-making on a real-time basis. We intend to build discrete ML- AI models that target fee optimization, income fraud, acquisition targeting, loan stacking, prepayment prediction, identity fraud and time-delimited default prediction. These models would be designed to incorporate multiple lending underwriting variables and utilize training dataset that accounts for varieties of repayment events. It is also anticipated that the network effects generated by constantly improving ML- AI models would provide a significant competitive advantage—and more training data would lead to higher approval rates and lower interest rates at the same loss rate (3) Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (“Blackchain”) The Company intends to acquire an existing, or build-from-the-scratch, a Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (“Blackchain”), with home in the BlackBank alongside the ML-AI lending platform. Blockchain-powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform would also provide efficient and inexpensive payment platform and merchant services to black businesses across the United States. The company would establish an exchange network called Blackchain Exchange Network (“BEN”), a Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform, would be a wholly-owned subsidiary, the BlackBank. We believe Blackchain would be a leading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services to participants in the nascent and expanding digital currency industry. Blackchain business strategy is floating a Blackchain Exchange Network, or BEN, a virtually instantaneous payment network for participants in the digital currency industry which would serve as a platform for the development of additional products and services. The BEN would have a network effect that would make it valuable as participants and utilization increase, leading to good growth in BEN transaction volumes. The BEN would enable the BlackBank to prioritize, build and significantly grow noninterest bearing deposit product for digital currency industry participants, which is expected to provide the majority of our bank funding in the next two years from finalizing acquisition. This unique source of funding would be a distinctive advantage over most traditional financial institutions and allows BlackBank to generate revenue from a conservative portfolio of investments in cash, short term securities and ML-Ai enabled loans that we believe generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, use of the BEN would result in an increase in noninterest income that we believe will become a valuable source of additional future revenue as we develop and deploy blockchain-powered, fee-based solutions in connection with our digital currency initiative. We would also evaluate additional products or product enhancements specifically targeted at providing further financial infrastructure solutions to our customers and strengthening BEN network effects. Blackchain Business Overview Once acquired, the Federally licensed one-four branch bank would be such that is already providing banking and financial services including commercial banking, business lending, commercial and residential real estate lending and mortgage warehouse lending, all funded primarily by interest bearing deposits and borrowings. To that up and running banking and financial services operation, we intend to insert a Blockchain-powered payment and transaction processing system and digital currency platform. We intend to pursue digital currency customers and bring them into the BlackBank to bank with us using digital currency. We believe we could effectively leverage the traditional commercial bank platform, the ML-Ai enabled lending platform and the attributes of the BEN to gain traction in the digital currency banking industry. We intend to focus on the digital currency initiative as the core of our future strategy and direction. We intend to build a leadership position in the digital currency industry as a result of the BEN to enable us to establish a significant balance of noninterest bearing deposits from digital currency customer base. Over several post-acquisition years, BlackBank would have transitioned from a traditional asset based bank model focused on loan generation to a deposit and solutions based model focused on increasing noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income. This emphasis on noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income, is primarily associated with digital currency, will likely result in a significant shift in BlackBank’s asset composition with a greater percentage consisting of liquid assets such as interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of loans. Most of our actions would be focused on developing and delivering highly scalable and operationally efficient solutions for BlackBank’s digital currency customers. (4) Emerging Cryptocurrency Opportunities Portfolio The emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio is the wildcard of our FINTEC business model. While the goals are clear, because it is a wildcard, there is no outline on what to expect or how it should be run. GMPW needs these flexibilities because many established companies are jumping into the crypocurrency opportunities on a minutes notice. For example, in 2020, Microstrategy decided to move their treasury into bitcoin as part of their cash management strategy. Marathon Patent Group moved into cryptocurrency mining as a business model. Overstock has been in cryptocurrency for a while. Square and Paypal just joined the bandwagon of American companies that try to find and exploit opportunities in the crypto currency industry without abandoning their actual businesses. GMPW’s emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio would not be different. The company would on an ongoing basis evaluate and consider investments into potentially viable cryptocurrency opportunities anywhere. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 Revenue We are generating substantially all our revenue from sales of real estate investment property and our proprietary trading operation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from real estate sales was $1,205,000 and revenue from proprietary trading was $423,136 for a total revenue of $1,628,136. Compared to proprietary trading revenue of $464 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenue is totally related to the cost of acquiring the real estate investment property and the trading securities sold. Cost related to our real estate investment property and the trading securities sold for the year December 31, 2020 were $1,179,827 and 374,691 respectively. Operating Expenses Operating expense for the year was $159,463. Operating expense consists of costs related to the establishment of corporate governances; and costs associated with our plans and preparations for a future potential capital raise. These expenses also include the costs of conducting market research, attending and/or participating in industry conferences and seminars, business development activities, and professional fees, other general business outside consulting activities. Operating expense also includes travel costs, for third-party consultants, legal and accounting fees and other professional and administrative costs. We expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future as we add to our personnel and expand our infrastructure to support the requirements of being a public company. Net Loss Net Loss for the year was $82,980. Related Party Transactions The following individuals and entities have been identified as related parties based on their affiliation with our CEO and director, Frank I Igwealor: Frank I Igwealor Goldstein Franklin, Inc. The following amounts were owed to related parties, affiliated with the CEO and Chairman of the Board, at the dates indicated: Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we had $500 cash on hand. We anticipate that our cash position is not sufficient to fund current operations. We have limited lending relationships with commercial banks and are dependent upon the completion of one or more financings or equity raises to fund our continuing operations. We anticipate that we will seek additional capital through debt or equity financings. While we are aggressively pursuing financing, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our capital raising efforts. Any additional equity financing may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. Since 2019, all of our operations have been financed through advances from a company controlled by our president and CEO. As of December 31, 2020, the company controlled by our president and CEO has loaned $604,156 to us, with no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan any additional funds to us in the future. We have not yet achieved significant profitability. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve significant profitability. We may never achieve significant profitability. The revenues, if any, generated from our operations or acquisitions may not be sufficient to fund our operations or planned growth. We will require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business. Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. We will now be obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time- consuming and costly. In order to meet the needs to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, we will need investment of capital. Management has determined that additional capital will be required in the form of equity or debt securities. There is no assurance that management will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future obligations, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced, shareholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies, relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. Unless otherwise discussed herein, management of the Company has determined that these recent accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company utilizes ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure, for valuing financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. Stock-Based Compensation We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by us in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash. Deferred Tax Assets and Income Taxes Provision The Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13. The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. Management assumes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (“NOL”) carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses and presently has no revenue-producing business; (b) general economic conditions; and, (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors. Seasonality Although our operating history is limited, we do not consider our business to be seasonal. Commercial Real Property As at December 31, 2020, the Company has no commercial real estate. Line of Credit As at December 31, 2020, we have on our book $63,632 classified as long-term debt. This debt is from an interest-free line of credit from a related party. Not applicable The consolidated financial statements of Givemepower Corporation including the notes thereto, are presented beginning at page F-1 and are incorporated by reference herein. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM GIVEMEPOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY Consolidated Financial Statements As of December 31, 2020 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To The Board of Directors and Shareholders Givemepower Corporation 370 Amapola Ave., Suite 200A Torrance, CA 90501 Opinion on the financial statements We audited the accompanying balance sheets of Givemepower Corporation (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis of Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits. we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Going Concern The Company’s financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of the liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,351,470 and had a negative cash flow from operations amounting to $120,008 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors as discussed in Note 6 of the financial statements raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 6. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters arising from the current period of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosure that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Madhava Rao, Chartered Accountant Bangalore, India April 13, 2021 The accompanying notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements The accompanying notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS GiveMePower Corporation (the “GMPW,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) operates and manages a portfolio of real estate and financial services assets and operations to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources. Givemepower is primarily focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate properties and businesses in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of, Nevada on June 7, 2001, to sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States, through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary GiveMePower Inc. On December 31, 2019, the company sold one (1) Special 2019 series A preferred share (one preferred share is convertible 100,000,000 share of common stocks) of the company for an agreed upon purchase price to Goldstein Franklin, Inc., a California corporation. The Special preferred share controls 60% of the company’s total voting rights. The issuance of the preferred share to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. gave to Goldstein Franklin, the controlling vote to control and dominate the affairs of the company going forward. The Company’s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December 31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company’s operating subsidiaries. Alpharidge Capital LLC (“Alpharidge”) was formed under the laws of the State of California on August 30, 2019. Alpharidge has two distinct lines of businesses that comprise: (1) a specialty biopharmaceutical holding company focused on building portfolio of real estate investment properties and equity positions in select companies within select industries; and (2) an event-driven investment management operation that invests in equities, warrants, bonds and options of public and private companies in America and across the globe. Prior to the transaction, the Company sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. On September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for $3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (“CED Capital”), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company expects to assume more than 50% of another entity’s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87% voting control of Givemepower Corporation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include its wholly owned subsidiaries of Alpharidge Capital LLC. (“Alpharidge”), Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (“CED Capital”), and Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), and subsidiaries, in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (“VIE”) provisions of ASC 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (“VIE”) provisions of ASC 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. ASC 810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a “variable interest beneficiary” when, per an arrangement’s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE’s expected losses or will receive a portion of the entity’s “residual returns.” The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest in the VIE is designated as its “primary beneficiary” and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains a “controlling financial interest” in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that have the greatest influence over the VIE’s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE’s significant losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the ASC 810 test above, Kid Castle Educational Corporation is the primary beneficiary of GiveMePower Corporation (the “VIE”) because Kid Castle retained a controlling financial interest in the VIE and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE, having the greatest influence over the VIE’s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE’s significant losses and the right to determine and receive benefits from the VIE. Because GiveMePower Corporation is 88% controlled by Kid Castle Educational Corporation, the consolidation rule requires that the Revenue, Assets and Liabilities recognized and disclosed on the financial statements of GiveMePower Corporation are also recognized and disclosed on the financial statements of Kid Castle Educational Corporation pursuant to ASC 810.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) promulgated in the United States of America. Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of GiveMePower Corporation and all of its controlled subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in business entities in which the company does not have control, but it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally 20% to 50% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Operating results of acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition. The company consolidates variable interest entities if it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity. Operating results for variable interest entities in which the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date such determination is made. For convenience and ease of reference, the company refers to the financial statement caption “Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income” throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. COVID-19 Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties COVID-19 Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties — the company is subject to the risks arising from COVID-19's impacts on the residential real estate industry. The Company’s management believes that these impacts, which include but are not limited to the following, could have a significant negative effect on its future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows: (i) prohibitions or limitations on in-person activities associated with residential real estate transactions; (ii) lack of consumer desire for in-person interactions and physical home tours; and (iii) deteriorating economic conditions, such as increased unemployment rates, recessionary conditions, lower yields on individuals' investment portfolios, and more stringent mortgage financing conditions. In addition, the company has considered the impacts and uncertainties of COVID-19 in its use of estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. These estimates include, but are not limited to, likelihood of achieving performance conditions under performance-based equity awards, net realizable value of inventory, and the fair value of reporting units and goodwill for impairment. In April 2020, following the government lockdown order, the company asked all employees to begin to work from their homes and the company also reduced the number of hours available to each of its employees by approximately by approximately 75%. These actions taken in response to the economic impact of COVID-19 on its business resulted in a reduction of productivity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020. All cost related to these actions are included in general and administrative expenses, as these costs were determined to be direct and incremental. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Negative cash balances (bank overdrafts) are reclassified on the balance sheet to “Other current liabilities.” The Company has $1,630 and $500 in cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including: expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. This process may result in actual results differing materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of the financial statements. Acquisitions of Businesses We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting (other than acquisitions of businesses under common control), which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. In valuing our acquisitions, we estimate fair values based on industry data and trends and by reference to relevant market rates and transactions, and discounted cash flow valuation methods, among other factors. The discount rates used were commensurate with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset and the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and our existing businesses and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition, Investments and Disposition of Entities under Common Control Acquisitions or investments of entities under common control are reflected in a manner similar to pooling of interests. The non-controlling interests, as applicable, are charged or credited for the difference between the consideration we pay for the entity and the related entity’s basis prior to our acquisition or investment. Net gains or losses of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition or investment date are allocated to the non-controlling interests, as applicable. In allocating gains and losses upon the sale of a previously acquired common control entity, we allocate a gain or loss for financial reporting purposes by first restoring the non-controlling interests, as applicable, for the cumulative charges or credits relating to prior periods recorded at the time of our acquisition or investment and then allocating the remaining gain or loss (“Common Control Gains or Losses”) among non-controlling interests, as applicable, in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. In the case of acquisitions of entities under common control, such Common Control Gains or Losses are allocated in accordance with their respective ownership partnership percentages. Investments Investment Transactions and Related Investment Income (Loss). Investment transactions of the Investment Funds are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are based on the first-in, first-out or the specific identification method. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual basis and dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Premiums and discounts on fixed income securities are amortized using the effective yield method. Investments held by our Investment segment are carried at fair value. Our Investment segment applies the fair value option to those investments that are otherwise subject to the equity method of accounting. Valuation of Investments . Securities of the Investment Funds that are listed on a securities exchange are valued at their last sales price on the primary securities exchange on which such securities are traded on such date. Securities that are not listed on any exchange but are traded over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the last “bid” and “ask” price for such security on such date. Securities and other instruments for which market quotes are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Funds. Foreign Currency Transactions. The books and records of the Investment Funds are maintained in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Transactions during the period denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Investment Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations are reflected in net gain (loss) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair Values of Financial Instruments. The fair values of the Investment Funds’ assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments under applicable U.S. GAAP approximate the carrying amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets. Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased. The Investment Funds may sell an investment they do not own in anticipation of a decline in the fair value of that investment. When the Investment Funds sell an investment short, they must borrow the investment sold short and deliver it to the broker-dealer through which they made the short sale. A gain, limited to the price at which the Investment Funds sold the investment short, or a loss, unlimited in amount, will be recognized upon the cover of the short sale. Due From Brokers. Due from brokers represents cash balances with the Investment Funds’ clearing brokers. These funds as well as fully-paid for and marginable securities are essentially restricted to the extent that they serve as collateral against securities sold, not yet purchased. Due from brokers may also include unrestricted balances with derivative counterparties. Due To Brokers. Due to brokers represents margin debit balances collateralized by certain of the Investment Funds’ investments in securities. Other Segments and Holding Company Investments in equity and debt securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. For purposes of determining gains and losses, the cost of securities is based on specific identification. Dividend income is recorded when declared and interest income is recognized when earned. Stock Based Compensation ASC 718 ""Compensation - Stock Compensation"" which codified SFAS No. 123 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payments award to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: ( a ) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or ( b ) the present obligation is implied because of an entity's past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction is recognized as a liability; otherwise, the transaction is recognized as equity. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50 ""Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees"" which codified SFAS 123 and the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus in Issue No. 96-18 ( ""EITF 96-18”) , ""Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services."" Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. The company did not record any share-based compensation during the year ended December 31, 2020. Sale and Repurchase of Common Stock Sales of Common Stock for Cash: We account for common stock sales for cash under the par value method. Common Stock account is credited for the number of shares sold times the par value per share, and the Paid in Capital account is credited for the remainder. Treasury Stock Repurchase: We account for repurchased common stock under the cost method and include such Treasury stock as a component of our Common shareholders’ equity. Retirement of Treasury stock is recorded as a reduction of Common stock and Additional paid-in capital at the time such retirement is approved by our Board of Directors. Receivables from Sale of Stock: Receivables from the sale of capital stock constitute unpaid capital subscriptions and are reported as deductions from stockholders' equity, rather than as assets. However, a receivable from the sale of stock to officers or directors may be reflected as an asset if the receivable was paid in cash before the financial statements were issued and the payment date is disclosed in a note to the financial statements. Expenses of Offering: Specific incremental costs directly attributable to an offering of securities are deferred and applied to the gross proceeds of the offering through additional paid-in capital. Management salaries and other general and administrative expenses are not included in costs of an offering. Deferred costs of an aborted offering, which would include a postponement of 90 days or greater, are expensed in the period incurred. The company has no treasury stock and no receivables from sales of stock during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires that five basic steps be followed to recognize revenue: (1) a legally enforceable contract that meets criteria standards as to composition and substance is identified; (2) performance obligations relating to provision of goods or services to the customer are identified; (3) the transaction price, with consideration given to any variable, noncash, or other relevant consideration, is determined; (4) the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations; and (5) revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer with consideration given, whether that control happens over time or not. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on our management’s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products and services delivered and the collectability of those amounts. The adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for any of the in-scope revenue streams; as such, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded. The Company generates revenue primarily from: (1) the sale of homes/ properties, (2) commissions and fees charged on each real estate services transaction closed by our lead agents or partner agents, and (3) sales of trading securities using its broker firm, TD Ameritrade less original purchase cost. Net trading revenues primarily consist of revenues from trading securities earned upon completion of trade, net of any trading fees. A trading is completed when earned and recognized at a point in time, on a trade-date basis, as the Company executes trades. The Company records trading revenue on a net basis, trading sales less original purchase cost. Net realized gains and losses from securities transactions are determined for federal income tax and financial reporting purposes on the first-in, first-out method and represent proceeds on disposition of investments less the cost basis of investments. Sale of real estate properties are recognized at the sales price/amount and the total cost (including cost of rehabilitations) associated with the property acquisition and rehabilitation are classified in Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did recognized revenue of $1,628,136 consisting of $1,205,000.00 from sales of real estate properties, $423,136 from trading revenues, and $173.53 in dividend income respectively. Real Estate Revenue Recognition: Revenue from real estate sales and related costs are recognized at the time of closing primarily by specific identification. We shall account for our leases as follows: (i) for operating leases, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term and (ii) for financing leases (x) minimum lease payments to be received plus the estimated value of the property at the end of the lease are considered the gross investment in the lease and (y) unearned income, representing the difference between gross investment and actual cost of the leased property, is amortized to income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease. Comprehensive Income The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” which requires that an enterprise report, by major components and as a single total, the changes in equity. The other comprehensive income items result from mark-to-market analysis of the company’s Marketable Securities. The company has zero other comprehensive income items during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include general operating expenses, costs incurred for activities which serve securing sales, administrative and advertising expenses. Disputed Liabilities The Company is involved in a variety of disputes, claims, and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has $0 in disputed liabilities on its balance sheet. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and, (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable upon examination, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties, if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable. As of January 1, 2021, the Company had analyzed its filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions that required the filing of income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and California are identified as the “major” tax jurisdictions. Generally, the Company remains subject to Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Board examination of our 2018 through 2019 Tax Returns. However, the Company has certain tax attribute carry forwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized. Management believed that the income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to the financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax position have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, the Company not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and consist solely of computer equipment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets and starts when the asset is available for use as intended by management. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The useful lives of tangible fixed assets are as follows: · Buildings 33 to 50 years · Permanent installations 3 to 25 years · Machinery and equipment 3 to 14 years · Furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 5 to 10 years · Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized within “Other operating income” or “Other operating expenses” in the income statement. Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company has no property or equipment. Earnings (Loss) per Share The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260, ""Earnings per Share,"" (""EPS"") which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the annual and interim income statement and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company’s dilutive loss per share is computed by taking basic EPS and adjusting for the assumed issuance of all potentially dilutive securities such as options, warrants, share-based payments, convertible debt and convertible preferred stock for each period since they were issued. This is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. On December 31, 2019, the company sold to Goldstein Franklin, Inc., a California corporation, one (1) Special 2019 series A preferred share (one preferred share is convertible 100,000,000 share of common stocks) of the company, which controls 60% of the company’s total voting rights. Similarly, on September 16, 2020, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, in exchange for 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (“CED Capital”), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (“CBDX”), a California corporation. Apart from the above mentioned preferred shares, the Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2020. A basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year. Dilutive earnings per share include the effect of any potentially dilutive debt or equity under the treasury stock method, if including such instruments is dilutive. The Company’s diluted earnings (loss) per share is the same as the basic earnings/loss per share for the period twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect. Accumulated Deficit As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has accumulated deficit of $6,351,470 and $6,099,876 respectively , which will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to limits of approximately $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts. It is possible that at times, the company’s cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. In such situation, the Company's management would assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures would be addressed and mitigated. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” include cash, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis. The fair value option gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value pursuant to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments . The election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. In estimating the fair value for financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected, we use the valuation methodologies in accordance to where the financial instruments are classified within the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements.” For our Investment segment, we apply the fair value option to our investments that would otherwise be accounted under the equity method. FASB ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: · Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; · Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and · Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company’s financial instruments consisted of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and line of credit. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to or from affiliated companies, and notes payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. The table below describes the Company’s valuation of financial instruments using guidance from ASC 820-10: Investment Investments and securities purchased, not yet sold consist of equities, bonds, bank debt and other corporate obligations, all of which are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. These investments are considered trading securities. In addition, our Investment segment has certain derivative transactions which are discussed below in “Financial Instruments.” Investment Securities (Trading): The Company applied the fair value accounting treatment for trading securities per ASC 320, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in net income each period. Debt securities classified as trading should be measured at fair value in the currency in which the debt securities are denominated and remeasured into the investor’s functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2020 are summarized based on the following: Financial Instruments In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds may trade various financial instruments and enter into certain investment activities, which may give rise to off-balance-sheet risks, with the objective of capital appreciation or as economic hedges against other securities or the market as a whole. The Investment Funds’ investments may include futures, options, swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. These financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments or to exchange an amount of cash based on the change in an underlying instrument at specific terms at specified future dates. Risks arise with these financial instruments from potential counterparty non-performance and from changes in the market values of underlying instruments. Credit concentrations may arise from investment activities and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. The Investment Funds routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, resulting in credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry. In the ordinary course of business, the Investment Funds may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty. The Investment Funds seek to mitigate these risks by actively monitoring exposures, collateral requirements and the creditworthiness of its counterparties. The Investment Funds have entered into various types of swap contracts with other counterparties. These agreements provide that they are entitled to receive or are obligated to pay in cash an amount equal to the increase or decrease, respectively, in the value of the underlying shares, debt and other instruments that are the subject of the contracts, during the period from inception of the applicable agreement to its expiration. In addition, pursuant to the terms of such agreements, they are entitled to receive or obligated to pay other amounts, including interest, dividends and other distributions made in respect of the underlying shares, debt and other instruments during the specified time frame. They are also required to pay to the counterparty a floating interest rate equal to the product of the notional amount multiplied by an agreed-upon rate, and they receive interest on any cash collateral that they post to the counterparty at the federal funds or LIBOR rate in effect for such period. The Investment Funds may trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, security, currency or cash at a specified price and specified future date unless the contract is closed before the delivery date. Payments (or variation margin) are made or received by the Investment Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and the whole value change is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss by the Investment Funds. When the contract is closed, the Investment Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. The Investment Funds may utilize forward contracts to seek to protect their assets denominated in foreign currencies and precious metals holdings from losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and spot rates. The Investment Funds’ exposure to credit risk associated with non-performance of such forward contracts is limited to the unrealized gains or losses inherent in such contracts, which are recognized in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The Investment Funds may also enter into foreign currency contracts for purposes other than hedging denominated securities. When entering into a foreign currency forward contract, the Investment Funds agree to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future date unless the contract is closed before such date. The Investment Funds record unrealized gains or losses on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into such contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date. Furthermore, the Investment Funds may also purchase and write option contracts. As a writer of option contracts, the Investment Funds receive a premium at the outset and then bear the market risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the underlying financial instrument. As a result of writing option contracts, the Investment Funds are obligated to purchase or sell, at the holder’s option, the underlying financial instrument. Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance-sheet risk, as the Investment Funds’ satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Certain terms of the Investment Funds’ contracts with derivative counterparties, which are standard and customary to such contracts, contain certain triggering events that would give the counterparties the right to terminate the derivative instruments. In such events, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions. Derivatives From time to time, our subsidiaries enter into derivative contracts, including purchased and written option contracts, swap contracts, futures contracts and forward contracts. U.S. GAAP requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item or are deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion of a financial instrument, determined using the hypothetical derivative method, is recognized in earnings immediately. The gain or loss related to financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. Cash flows related to hedging activities are included in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. For further information regarding our derivative contracts, see Note 6, “Financial Instruments.” Marginal Loan Payable The Company entered into a marginal loan agreement as part of its new trading account process in 2019 with TD Ameritrade, the Company’s brokerage to continue the purchase of securities and to fund the underfunded balance. The marginal loan payable bears interest at 0% per annum and interest and unpaid principal balance is payable on the maturity date. The balance of this account as of December 31, 2020 is $115. Leases As discussed below, on January 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, using the modified retrospective approach, which does not require the application of this Topic to periods prior to January 1, 2019. The application of this Topic requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities on the balance sheet for operating leases in which we are the lessee beginning in 2019. Financing leases under current U.S. GAAP are classified and accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases under prior U.S. GAAP and therefore, we do not distinguish between financing leases and capital leases unless the context requires. The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease occurs at inception. We account for arrangements that contain lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. The Company does not have operating and financing leases as of December 31, 2020. The adoption of ASC 842 did not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. All Segments and Holding Company Leases are classified as either operating or financing by the lessee depending on whether or not the lease terms provide for control of the underlying asset to be transferred to the lessee. When control transfers to the lessee, we classify the lease as a financing lease. All other leases are recorded as operating leases. Effective January 1, 2019, for all leases with an initial lease term in excess of twelve months, we record a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets are adjusted for any lease payments made on or before commencement of the lease, less any lease incentives received. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the incremental borrowing rate with respect to each of our businesses based on the information available at commencement of the lease in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The lease terms used in the determination of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities reflect any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. We and our subsidiaries, independently of each other, apply a portfolio approach to account for the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when we or our subsidiaries do not believe that applying the portfolio approach would be materially different from accounting for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities individually. Operating lease costs are recorded as a single expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease right-of-use assets are amortized for the difference between the straight-line expense less the accretion of interest of the related lease liability. Financing lease costs consists of interest expense on the financing lease liability as well as amortization of the right-of-use financing lease assets on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Real Estate Leases are classified as either operating, sales-type or direct financing by the lessor which are account for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842. These assets leased to others are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on our consolidated balance sheets. Assets leased to others are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from 5 years to 39 years. Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Cash receipts for all lease payments received are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Current Holdings of Real Estate Investments: As of December 31, 2020, the Company has one available-for-sale real estate properties with a carrying amount of $664,111: Inventory costs include direct home acquisition costs and any capitalized improvements. The following is the Real Estate Investments activities for the period under review: The 4904 S Wilton Place, Los Angeles, CA 90062 property was bought in April, 2019 for $498,984. Its goal for the property was to improve and resell to eligible homebuyers as part of its mission of promoting homeownership affordable housing. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has expended $165,127 on improvement of the property. Environmental Liabilities We recognize environmental liabilities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, internal and third-party assessments of contamination, available remediation technology, site-specific costs, and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. Loss contingency accruals, including those for environmental remediation, are subject to revision as further information develops or circumstances change, and such accruals can take into account the legal liability of other parties. Environmental expenditures are capitalized at the time of the expenditure when such costs provide future economic benefits. Litigation On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. Lending Investments The company intends to invest through loans and equity in targeted community-anchored businesses, properties and other viable assets. These investments and loans are short-term and long-term in nature. The firm makes investments in debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, and real estate. As at December 31, 2020, the Company owns and holds no investments. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Related Parties The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates of the Company; b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved b. description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. Related Party Transactions Affiliate Receivables and Payables Alpharidge considers its Founders, managing directors, employees, significant shareholders and the Portfolio Companies to be affiliates. In addition, companies controlled by any of the above named is also classified as affiliates. As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s controlling firm and significant stockholder advanced $63,632 to the Company for working capital. These advances are non-interest bearing and payable on demand. Details of Due from Affiliates and Due to Affiliates were comprised of the following: NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a net operating loss carry forward of $2,474,509 and $2,378,952 respectively, which may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income through 2040. The company uses the tax rate of 38.5% for tax-assets estimates. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows: Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Income Tax laws of the United States, 2020 and 2019 net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2,474,509 and $2,378,952 respectively, for federal income tax reporting purposes may be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. As the realization of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance. NOTE 4– RECENTLY ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Adoption of New Accounting Standards Lease Accounting Standards Updates In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases. This ASU requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. In addition, among other changes to the accounting for leases, this ASU retains the distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between financing leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under previous guidance. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including disclosures regarding significant judgments made by management, will be required. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. In addition, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), which provides an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new leases standard. We adopted the new leases standards using the new transition method option effective January 1, 2019, which required a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized in equity at such date. No adjustment to prior period presentation and disclosure were required. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Other Accounting Standards Updates In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities , which amends FASB ASC Sub-Topic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . This ASU amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium by shortening the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective application method. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which amends FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This ASU includes amendments to existing guidance to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted this standard on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which amends FASB ASC Topic 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income . This ASU allows a reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity for standard tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and consequently, eliminates the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which amends FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In addition, in May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief , which updates FASB ASU 2016-13. These ASU’s require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount to be collected and broadens the information, including forecasted information incorporating more timely information, that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured. These ASU’s are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Most of our financial assets are excluded from the requirements of this standard as they are measured at fair value or are subject to other accounting standards. In addition, certain of our other financial assets are short-term in nature and therefore are not likely to be subject to significant credit losses beyond what is already recorded under current accounting standards. As a result, we currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements , which amends FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements . This ASU eliminates, modifies and adds various disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Certain disclosures are required to be applied using a retrospective approach and others using a prospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The various disclosure requirements being eliminated, modified or added are not significant to us. As a result, we currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract , which amends FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software . This ASU adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a retrospective or prospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on “ Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ”. Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide such guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, "" Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. "" This ASU clarifies that the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, ""Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ."" applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, "" Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ."" The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, "" Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. "" This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, "" Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent's Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity ."" This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments should be released into net income and is intended by FASB to eliminate some disparity in current accounting practice. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, “ Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting. ” The amendments require an entity to prepare its financial statements using the liquidation basis of accounting when liquidation is imminent. Liquidation is imminent when the likelihood is remote that the entity will return from liquidation and either (a) a plan for liquidation is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution of the plan will be blocked by other parties or (b) a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary bankruptcy). If a plan for liquidation was specified in the entity’s governing documents from the entity’s inception (for example, limited-life entities), the entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting only if the approved plan for liquidation differs from the plan for liquidation that was specified at the entity’s inception. The amendments require financial statements prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting to present relevant information about an entity’s expected resources in liquidation by measuring and presenting assets at the amount of the expected cash proceeds from liquidation. The entity should include in its presentation of assets any items it had not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP but that it expects to either sell in liquidation or use in settling liabilities (for example, trademarks). The amendments are effective for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods therein. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements. Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. NOTE 5 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company is authorized to issue 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value and 10,000,000 preferred stocks, $0.001 par value. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they chose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 42,724,687 and 27,724,687 shares of common stock respectively, issued and outstanding held by 159 stockholders of record. The company had no transactions in its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, there were 1 share of preferred stock issued and outstanding held by 1 stockholder of rec ord. Minority Interest Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets represent minority stockholders’ proportionate share of the equity (deficit) in such subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As at December 31, 2020, minority shareholders’ proportionate share of the entity is three (3) percent and reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet. NOTE 6 – GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established a source of revenues to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. Management intends to focus on raising additional funds for the first and second quarters going forward. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that we will be able to generate revenues. Potential investors must be aware if the Company were unable to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock and generate sufficient revenues, any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety. The Company has net has accumulated deficit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $6,351,470 and $6,099,876 respectively . The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 7 – LONG TERM LOAN On July 3, 2020, the Company entered into SBA loan the amount of $150,000 with maturity date of July 2, 2050. The SBA loan bears interest at 3.75% per annum. Repayment starts on 12 months after closing. Total interest expense was $2,812 and $0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NOTE 8 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The managing member, CEO and director of the Company is involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, he may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and his other business interests. The Company is formulating a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. The Company had the following related party transactions: · Line of Credit – On September 15, 2019, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement in the amount of $41,200 with Goldstein Franklin, Inc. which is owned and operated by Frank I. Igwealor, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The maturity date of the line of credit is February 15, 2020.

Any waivers of, and any amendments to, our code of ethics will be disclosed promptly on our Internet website. Compensation Discussion and Analysis Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation As the Board of Directors does not have a Compensation Committee, the independent directors of the Board oversee the Company’s executive compensation program. We currently do not have independent directors on our Board. Compensation for the CEO and the CFO is approved by the Independent Directors of the Board or the general Board. Compensation for other executive officers and senior management is determined by the CEO and CFO pursuant to the Board of Directors delegating to the CEO and CFO authority to do so. Elements to Executive Compensation The Company’s executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain executives responsible for the Company’s long-term success, to reward executives for achieving both financial and strategic company goals and to provide a compensation package that recognizes individual contributions as well as overall business results. The Company’s executive compensation program also takes into account the compensation practices of companies with whom Givemepower competes for executive talent. The two components of the Company’s executive compensation program are base salary and annual discretionary bonuses. Overall compensation is intended to be competitive for comparable positions at peer companies. Objectives . The objectives of the Company’s executive compensation policies are to attract and retain highly qualified executives by designing the total compensation package to motivate executives to provide excellent leadership and achieve Company goals; to align the interests of executives, employees, and stockholders by establishing cohesive management, financial, operation and marketing goals that reflect the Company’s strategic growth plan; and to provide executives with reasonable security, through retirement plan and annual discretionary bonuses that motivate them to continue employment with the Company and achieve goals that will make the Company thrive and remain competitive in the long-run. Linkage between compensation programs and Company objective and values . We link executive compensation closely with the Company objectives, which we believe are dependent on the level of employee engagement, operational excellence, cost management and profitability achieved. Currently, the primary quantifiable measurement of operational excellence for the Company is the achievement of profitability, which is directly related to increasing annual revenue. Executives’ annual performance evaluations are based in part on their achievement of the aforementioned goals and in part on revenue targets that may be established by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each fiscal year. The Board of Directors has not set a specific revenue goal for the award of bonuses for fiscal 2018. The Company currently does not have a defined non-equity incentive plan in place for its named executives. Instead, the disinterested members of the Board of Directors determine if any annual discretionary bonuses should be awarded to named executives in conjunction with the named executives’ annual performance evaluations. As indicated in the table below, during the last three fiscal years, the Board of Directors has not elected to award any annual discretionary bonuses to any named executives. The roles of various elements of compensation . Executive compensation includes base salary, annual discretionary bonuses awarded by the Board of Directors in conjunction with named executives’ annual performance evaluations and other annual compensation granted under the noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan. Collectively, the Board’s objective is to ensure a total pay package that is appropriate given the performance of both the Company and the individual named executive. Governance practices concerning compensation . The Board of Directors has implemented a number of procedures that the Board follows to ensure good governance concerning compensation. These include setting CEO and CFO salaries, authorizing the CEO or the CFO to determine the salaries of presidents and vice presidents, including Mrs. Huang, President of Shanghai operations, establishing annual goals for the Company, reviewing proposals for stock incentive plans, exercising fiduciary responsibilities over retirement plans, overseeing management development and succession planning, and keeping adequate records of its activities. Base Salary Each executive’s base salary is initially determined with reference to competitive pay practices of peer companies (where such information is publicly available) and is dependent upon the executive’s level of responsibility and experience. The Board uses its discretion, rather than a formal weighting system, to evaluate these factors and to determine individual base salary levels. Thereafter, base salaries are reviewed periodically, and increases are made based on the Board of Director’s subjective assessment of individual performance, as well as the factors discussed above. Annual Discretionary Bonuses In future years we shall pay variable incentive compensation to our executives, however, due to our overall performance in 2019 and 2018, our executive officers were not awarded bonuses. Summary Compensation Table The following table sets forth information about the compensation paid or accrued by our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and one other most highly compensated executive officer (our “named officers”) for the last three completed fiscal years Summary Compensation Table Notes: Stock Option Grants in the Last Fiscal Year; Exercises of Stock Options There were no grants of stock options during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

1066194,"Key Financial Measures We monitor the key financial performance measures set forth below as well as cash and cash equivalents and available debt capacity, which are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational effectiveness and efficiencies. SaaS Revenues With our transition to a SaaS only business model, we believe SaaS revenue better reflects our business momentum and to analyze progress and thus, we disaggregate our subscription revenue growth between: ​ The following table presents a break out of subscription revenue between SaaS and legacy revenues for each of the following periods: ​ As we continue to migrate our legacy perpetual license clients to SaaS, we expect our legacy revenue to continue to decline. ​ SaaS and Professional Services Revenue ​ As we continue to shift to a SaaS only business model, substantially all of professional services revenue is now generated from our SaaS customer base. We believe the combination of SaaS and professional services revenue is a useful measure to value our business on a forward-looking basis. ​ The following table presents total SaaS and professional services revenue for each of the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ 36 Non-GAAP Operating Income ​ Non-GAAP operating income is defined as operating income, adjusted for the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Management believes that it is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges and non-core operational charges from non-GAAP operating income because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations; and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of new stock-based awards and acquisitions. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP income from operations to non-GAAP income from operations for each of the following periods: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ​ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. ​ We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of deferred tax allowance, and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ​ Sources of Revenues ​ Our revenue is comprised of two categories, subscription and professional services. Subscription includes SaaS revenue and legacy revenue. SaaS revenue includes revenue from cloud delivery arrangements, term licenses and embedded OEM royalties and associated support. Legacy revenue is associated with license, maintenance and support contracts on perpetual license arrangements that we no longer sell. Professional services include consulting, implementation and training. ​ Subscription Revenue ​ For our cloud delivery arrangements, our maintenance and support arrangements and our term license subscriptions that incorporate substantial cloud functionality, the combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the obligation is delivered. For contracts involving distinct software licenses, the license performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. 37 We typically invoice our customers in advance upon execution of the contract or subsequent renewals. Invoiced amounts are recorded in accounts receivable, deferred revenue or revenue, depending on when control is transferred to our customers based on each arrangement. ​ We have a royalty revenue agreement with a customer related to our embedded intellectual property. Under the terms of the agreement, the customer is to provide a combined fixed fee, per agent, for each software license sold containing the embedded software to us. These embedded OEM royalties are included as subscription revenue. Under Topic 606-10-55-65 revenue guidance (Topic 606), since these arrangements are for sales-based licenses of intellectual property, we recognize revenue only as the subsequent sale occurs. However, since such sales are reported by the customer with a quarter in arrears, such revenue is recognized at the time it is reported and paid by the customer given that any estimated variable consideration would have to be fully constrained due to the unpredictability of such estimate and the unavoidable risk that it may lead to significant revenue reversals. ​ Professional Services Revenue ​ Professional services revenue includes system implementation, consulting and training. The transaction price is allocated to various performance obligations based on their stand-alone selling prices. Revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as work is performed. Our consulting and implementation service contracts are bid either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-fee basis. Fixed fees are generally paid on milestone billing at pre-determined points in the contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. Training revenue that meets the criteria to be accounted for separately is recognized when training is provided. ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that have not yet been recognized, and include billed deferred revenues, consisting of amounts invoiced to customers whether collected or uncollected which have not been recognized as revenues, as well as unbilled amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations are influenced by a variety of factors, including seasonality, timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency rates. As of June 30, 2021, our remaining performance obligations were $65.4 million of which we expect to recognize $55.2 million and $10.2 million as revenue within one year and beyond one year, respectively. ​ We expect our remaining performance obligations to change quarterly for several reasons including the timing of new contracts and renewals, duration and size of our subscription and support arrangements, variable billing cycles and foreign exchange rate fluctuation. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period. Depending on timing, the initial invoice and subsequent renewal invoices may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase or decrease to our accounts receivable and deferred revenue. ​ Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts ​ Under Topic 606, we capitalize incremental costs to obtain non-cancelable subscription and maintenance and support revenue contracts with amortization periods that may extend longer than the non-cancelable subscription and maintenance and support revenue contract terms. ​ We capitalize incremental costs of obtaining a non-cancelable subscription and maintenance and support revenue contract with amortization periods of one year or more. The capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (i) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired and (ii) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to our employees. ​ Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be five years. We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the 38 period from initial contract through renewal, which constitutes the length of our customer relationship or customer life. Amortization of costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts is included as a component of sales and marketing expense in our operating results. ​ Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation . Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of the stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes valuation assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives. We determine the appropriate measure of expected volatility by reviewing historic volatility in the share price of our common stock, as adjusted for certain events that management deems to be non-recurring and non-indicative of future events. We base our estimate of expected life on the historical exercise behavior, cancellations of all past option grants made by us during the time period in which our common stock has been publicly traded, the contractual term, the vesting period and the expected remaining term of the option. Based on our historical experience of option pre-vesting cancellations, we have assumed an annualized 10.79% forfeiture rate for our options. We record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated and record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than what we estimated. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We review goodwill annually for impairment or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. In addition, we evaluate purchased intangible assets to determine that all such assets have determinable lives. We operate under a single reporting unit and accordingly, all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company. We had no impairment for fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We extend unsecured credit to customers on a regular basis. Our accounts receivable is derived from revenue earned from customers and are not interest bearing. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables. We review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. We exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions. If we make different judgments or utilize different estimates, then material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables, which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented. We write-off a receivable after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the amount is deemed uncollectible. As described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, certain Company contracts have contractual billings which do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract. Unbilled accounts receivables are recorded when revenue recognized on the contract exceeds billings, pursuant to contract provisions, and become billable at contractually specified dates. Tax Legislation On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act revised the taxation of U.S. and multinational corporations which significantly reduced the statutory corporate U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the ability of corporations to deduct interest expense and made taxation changes on U.S. multinational corporation’s foreign operations. The provisions of the Tax Act are complex and likely will be subject to regulatory and administrative guidance. The Tax Act includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. For the 39 fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we have $923,000 of GILTI income inclusion and used our net operating losses to offset our taxable income. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we did not incur any BEAT tax. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), P.L. 116-136,was passed into law, amending portions of certain relevant US tax laws. The CARES Act included a number of federal income tax law changes, including, but not limited to: (i) permitting net operating loss carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021, (ii) accelerating alternative minimum tax credit refunds, (iii) temporarily increasing the allowable business interest deduction from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income, and (iv) providing a technical correction for depreciation related to qualified improvement property. The CARES Act had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). The CAA contains numerous individual, business, payroll, disaster, and energy-related tax provisions, as well as tax extenders. Many of the provisions, including $600 stimulus payments, and an extension of payroll credits, relate to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020 (COVIDTRA) and the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (TCDTR), both part of the CAA, contains numerous provisions related to businesses. We continue to examine the elements of the CARES Act and CAA and the impact they may have on our future business. Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was a tax benefit of 2.4% and a tax provision of 9.7%, respectively. The change in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the expiration of tax attributes, the change in valuation allowance, foreign rate differential, GILTI inclusion, stock-based compensation and the research and development tax credit. The income before income tax provision between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution and customer demand related to our products and services. In fiscal year 2021, our U.S. and foreign income before our income tax provision was $5.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2020, our U.S. and foreign income before our income tax provision was $5.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. The net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $35.5 million of which approximately $31.1 million was attributable to U.S. and state net operating losses and domestic research and development credit carryforwards. We apply ASC 740, Income Taxes , in determining any uncertain tax positions. The guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Under ASC 740, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, on the basis of estimates, that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestments of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $18.7 million of undistributed earnings of foreign 40 subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. If we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We do not have any derivative financial instruments. We believe the reported carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value, based upon their short-term nature and comparable market information available at the respective balance sheet dates. Results of Operations ​ The following table sets forth certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated: ​ ​ Revenue ​ We classify our revenue into two categories; subscription and professional services revenue. We further break down subscription revenue into SaaS revenue and legacy revenue, with SaaS revenue being a key metric. ​ The following table presents our subscription and professional services revenue during the fiscal years indicated: ​ ​ Total Revenue Total revenue increased $5.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from the comparable period in 2020, largely due to increased revenues from SaaS of $10.1 million in fiscal year 2021. This increase was partially offset by a decline in our legacy revenue as we continue to migrate legacy perpetual license customers to our SaaS model and a decline 41 in professional service revenue as we continue to see a reduction in time required for an average implementation project, as a result of the improvements to our product deployment process. ​ Our revenue was impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and British Pound. We recalculate our current period results using the comparable prior period exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation. Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in an increase of $2.0 million and a decrease of $722,000 in total revenue during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ Subscription Revenue ​ SaaS Revenue ​ ​ SaaS revenue includes revenue from cloud delivery arrangements, term licenses and embedded OEM royalties and associated support. Revenues from SaaS increased by $10.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the comparable period in 2020. ​ SaaS revenue was $66.9 million and $56.8 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represented an increase of 18% or $10.1 million. SaaS revenue represents 85% and 78% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ Excluding an increase of $1.3 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation, SaaS revenue increased by $8.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the comparable period in 2020. In connection with our SaaS transition, we are actively migrating our remaining perpetual license clients to SaaS and continue to sell SaaS to new customers. We expect our SaaS revenue to increase in future periods. ​ Legacy Revenue ​ Legacy revenue is associated with license, maintenance and support contracts on perpetual license arrangements that we no longer sell. We experienced a decrease of $3.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to our focus on migrating our legacy customers to SaaS. We expect these legacy fees to continue to decline in future periods. ​ Legacy revenue was $5.4 million and $9.3 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represented a decrease of 42% or $3.9 million. Legacy revenue represents 7% and 13% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ Excluding an increase of $433,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation, legacy revenue decreased by $4.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the comparable period in 2020. ​ ​ 42 Professional Services Revenue ​ Professional services revenue includes consulting, implementation and training. Revenues from professional services decreased by $684,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. These decreases were primarily due to continued improvements in our product deployment process resulting in a reduction in the time required for an average implementation project. As we continue to onboard new customers and migrate legacy customers to SaaS, we expect the time required for product deployment and implementation projects to decrease further. ​ Professional services revenue was $5.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, which represented a decrease of 10% or $684,000. Professional services revenue represents 8% and 9% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ Excluding an increase of $204,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation, professional services revenues decreased by $888,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the comparable period in 2020. ​ Revenue by Geography ​ ​ Revenue from domestic sales increased by 21% from $44.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 to $54.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 due to increases of (i) $8.4 million in SaaS revenue, (ii) $885,000 in legacy revenue, and (iii) $322,000 in professional service revenue. ​ Revenue from international sales decreased by 14% from $27.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 to $23.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 due to decreases of (i) $4.8 million in legacy revenue and (ii) $1.0 million in professional services revenue; offset by an increase of $1.8 million in SaaS revenue. ​ Cost of Revenue ​ ​ ​ 43 Subscription ​ Cost of subscription revenues consist primarily of expenses related to our cloud services and support provided to customers. These expenses are comprised of cloud computing costs, personnel-related costs directly associated with cloud operations, and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. ​ Cost of subscription revenues decreased by $891,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in (i) personnel related costs of $609,000, (ii) cloud computing cost of $344,000 and (iii) intangible asset amortization of $242,000, partially offset with an increase in outside consulting cost of $173,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from the comparable period in 2020. ​ Excluding an increase of $131,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation, cost of subscription revenues decreased by $1.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from the comparable period in 2020. Excluding any future foreign exchange rate fluctuation, we expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase in absolute dollar terms as revenues increase but expect subscription revenue gross margins to improve or remain relatively consistent. ​ Professional Services ​ Cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. ​ Cost of professional services decreased $923,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 from the comparable period in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of $902,000 and outside consulting costs of $158,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. ​ Excluding an increase of $137,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation, cost of professional services revenue decreased by $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from the comparable period in 2020. ​ Operating Expenses ​ Research and Development ​ Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our engineering, product management and development, and quality assurance staff. Included in these costs are salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expense also includes outside consulting services contracted for research and development, and amortization of intangible assets. ​ Research and development expense increased 8% to $17.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $16.6 million in the comparable period in 2020. Excluding an increase of $195,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound and Indian Rupee, research and development expense increased primarily due to an increase of $1.4 million in personnel-related costs; partially offset by a decrease of $277,000 in outside consulting costs. ​ Excluding any future foreign exchange rate fluctuation, we expect our research and development expense to increase in future periods based on our product development plans. ​ 44 Sales and Marketing ​ Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales, marketing, and business development staff. Included in these costs are salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include amortization of commissions paid to our sales staff, lead generation activities, advertising, trade show and other promotional costs and, to a lesser extent, occupancy costs and related overhead. ​ Sales and marketing expenses increased 32% to $26.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $19.6 million in the comparable period in 2020. Excluding an increase of $423,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound and Indian Rupee, sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to increases of (i) $6.2 million in personnel-related costs and (ii) $16,000 outside consulting services; partially offset by a decrease of $257,000 in marketing program costs. ​ Excluding any future foreign exchange rate fluctuation, we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue in future quarters based on our current business plan. ​ General and Administrative ​ General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our finance, human resources, administrative and legal personnel. Included in these costs are salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses also include fees for professional services, provision for doubtful accounts and, to a lesser extent, occupancy costs and related overhead. ​ General and administrative expense decreased 3% to $7.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $8.0 million in the comparable period in 2020. Excluding an increase of $131,000 due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound and Indian Rupee, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to decreases of (i) $349,000 in personnel-related expenses; (ii) $108,000 in accounting, audit, and administrative expenses; (iii) $106,000 in legal expenses; partially offset by increases of (a) $90,000 in outside consulting costs; (b) $69,000 in bad debt expenses; and (c) $42,000 in investor relations expense. ​ Excluding any future foreign exchange rate fluctuation, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase or remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue in future periods based on our current business plan. ​ Stock-Based Compensation ​ Stock-based compensation expense is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity-based payment awards made to employees, members of our board of directors and consultants, based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards. We value our share-based payments under ASC 718, and record compensation expense for all share-based payments made to employees based on the fair value at the date of the grant. 45 The effect of recording stock-based compensation for fiscal year 2021 and 2020 is as follows: ​ ​ Determining the fair value of the equity-based payment awards at the grant date required significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option term. ​ Below is a summary of stock-based compensation included in the cost and expenses: ​ ​ The increase in our stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to an increase in option grant activity. ​ We expect our stock-based compensation expense to increase in fiscal year 2022. ​ Income from Operations ​ Results from operations was income of $7.3 million in fiscal year 2021, compared to $7.4 million in fiscal year 2020. We recorded a positive operating margin of 9% in fiscal year 2021, and 10% in fiscal year 2020. The increase in operating income in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the growth of our cloud delivery business and improvement in our gross margins. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, SaaS revenue increased by $10.1 million to $66.9 million compared to $56.8 million in fiscal year 2020. Excluding a decrease from foreign exchange fluctuation of $1.0 million the increase in total costs and operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to increases of (i) $5.7 million in personnel-related expenses; (ii) $69,000 in bad debt expenses; and (iii) $42,000 in investor relations cost; partially offset by a decrease of (a) $344,000 in cloud computing costs; (b) $258,000 in marketing costs; (c) $242,000 in intangible asset amortization; (d) $156,000 in outside consulting costs; (e) $108,000 in accounting, audit and administrative services and; (f) $106,000 in legal expenses. Interest Income, Net ​ Interest income, net consists primarily of interest earned on money market funds. Interest income, net was income of $13,000 and $395,000 in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect interest income to remain relatively constant in future periods. 46 ​ Other (Expense) Income, Net ​ Other (expense) income, net was expense of $559,000 and income of $185,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other (expense) income, net primarily included foreign exchange rate fluctuations on international trade receivables. ​ Income Tax Provision ​ Provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to the current economic state of the U.S. economy, expiring tax attributes and uncertainty of future profitability, we maintain a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax benefit of $166,000 and an income tax provision of $778,000 in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ New Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. Liquidity and Capital Resources ​ Overview ​ At June 30, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable totaling $89.5 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $63.2 million and $46.6 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​ Our working capital was $31.1 million as of June 30, 2021 compared to $21.4 million as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, our deferred revenue was $49.5 million as compared to $41.5 million as of June 30, 2020. ​ Based upon our current business plan, we believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, however, we may consider opportunities for raising additional capital. We can make no assurances that such opportunities will be available to us on economic terms we consider favorable, if at all. ​ Our expectations as to our future cash flows and our future cash balances are subject to a number of assumptions, including assumptions regarding anticipated increases in our revenue, our ability to retain existing customers and customer purchasing and payment patterns, many of which are beyond our control. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 47 Cash Flows For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ Cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, expense associated with stock-based awards, the timing of employee related costs including costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, amortization of right-of-use assets, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year. ​ Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $196,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, driven primarily by the timing of prepayments received from customers for new cloud arrangements and the renewal of existing cloud and support arrangements, which is our largest source of operating cash flows, as well as higher net income. ​ Net cash used in investing activities increased by $112,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, driven primarily by activities related to the purchase of equipment for new employees and facility expenditures. Historically, cash used in investing activities has been used to purchase equipment and software to support our business and growth. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $942,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, principally consisted of proceeds from employee stock plans. ​ Commitments Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space. Lease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . ​ The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2021, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. ​ ​ ​ ​ 48",

The last day of our fiscal year is January 31. Our fiscal quarters end on April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. Our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are referred to herein as fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively. Overview Sumo Logic is the pioneer of Continuous Intelligence, a new category of software, which enables organizations of all sizes to address the challenges and opportunities presented by digital transformation, modern applications, and cloud computing. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform enables organizations to automate the collection, ingestion, and analysis of application, infrastructure, security, and IoT data to derive actionable insights within seconds. Continuous Intelligence leverages AI/ML capabilities, and is provided as a multi-tenant cloud service that allows organizations to more rapidly deliver reliable applications and digital services, protect against modern security threats, and consistently optimize their business processes in real time. This empowers employees across all lines of business, development, IT, and security teams with the data and insights needed to address the technology and collaboration challenges required for modern business. With our Continuous Intelligence Platform, executives and employees have the intelligence they require to take prescriptive action in real time—a modern business imperative. We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions to customers that enable them to access our cloud-native platform. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription, which is generally one year, but can be three years or longer. We offer multi-tiered paid subscription packages for access to our platform, the pricing for which differs based on a variety of factors, including volume of data to be ingested, duration of data retention, and breadth of access to platform features and functionalities. Our subscription packages encourage customers to expand their adoption of our platform by providing them with the flexibility to ingest and analyze large volumes of data and the ability to access a broad suite of platform features and functionalities without incurring overage fees, as well as insights into their usage patterns. We also deliver basic customer support with each of our paid subscription packages, and customers have the ability to purchase subscriptions to our premium support service. Our go-to-market strategy consists of self-service adoption through our website, an inside sales team, a field sales team, and a partner channel. We offer free trials that enable potential customers to experience the benefits of our platform, and we see significant conversion from our trial users to paid customers, with approximately one-third of our new customers in fiscal 2021 having been free trial users who converted into paying customers. We leverage our user community to proactively identify trends, gather global insights, and create new use cases, thereby empowering us to deliver out-of-the-box value to our customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around our platform offerings, which have a rapid time to value for our customers and are easily extensible to multiple use cases across a business. We utilize the analytical capabilities of our platform and our customer success team to understand how our customers use, and how they would benefit from expanding their use of, our platform. This understanding helps us successfully upsell and cross sell to our existing customers. The power of our platform, and the benefits that it delivers to customers, has driven rapid growth in our revenue. For fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, our revenue was $202.6 million, $155.1 million, and $103.6 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 31% and 50% respectively. We generated GAAP operating losses of $77.7 million, $93.1 million, and $48.2 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and impairment of capitalized internal-use software. We generated non-GAAP operating losses of $29.9 million, $58.8 million, and $41.3 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the reconciliation of GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss. Impact of COVID-19 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily closed or reduced capacity at our offices, required our employees and contractors to work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions, all of which represent a significant disruption in how we operate our business. Additionally, in May 2020, as part of our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure longer-term financial stability, we initiated cost reduction measures, including a headcount reduction. The operations of our partners and customers have likewise been disrupted, and we believe this has caused delays in renewal decisions for some of our existing customers, caused customers to request concessions such as extended payment terms or better pricing, and affected contraction or churn rates for our 47 customers. While the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the duration and spread of the outbreak, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts, it has already had an adverse effect on the global economy and the ultimate societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic could also accelerate customer transformation into digital businesses, which we expect will generate additional opportunities for us in the future. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our revenue until future periods. See “Risk Factors — The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has harmed and could continue to harm our business and results of operations” for further discussion of the challenges and risks we have encountered and could encounter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance New Customer Acquisition Our business depends, in part, on our ability to add new customers. As businesses transition to the public cloud and with the increasing number of cloud-native businesses, continuous intelligence will become even more of a strategic imperative. We believe this growing adoption of cloud infrastructure across all organizations will continue to drive demand for our platform and broaden our customer base. Since our platform has offerings for organizations of all sizes and across industries, including organizations of all stages of cloud maturity, we believe these market changes present a significant opportunity for growth. As of January 31, 2021, we had 2,164 customers worldwide, spanning organizations of a broad range of sizes and industries. However, we expect that our ability to add new customers may be negatively impacted by current economic uncertainty in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to focus on new customer acquisition by investing in sales and marketing to build brand awareness, expanding our community, and driving adoption of our platform as we further capture the opportunity in our addressable market. We define a customer as a separate legal entity, such as a company or an educational or government institution, that is under a paid contract with us or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract at the end of a given period. To the extent we are negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the contract, we continue to include that customer in our customer count if we are in active discussions for a renewal or upgrade. Given our historical experience of customer renewals, if we are in active discussions for a renewal or upgrade, we continue to include customers with expired contracts in our customer count until the customer either renews its contract or negotiations terminate without renewal. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions that separately contract with us, we typically treat only the parent entity as the customer instead of treating each subsidiary or division as a separate customer. However, we count each purchaser of our self-service offering as a unique customer, regardless of other subscriptions such organization may have. Expanding within our Existing Customer Base Our business depends, in part, on the degree to which our land-and-expand strategy is successful. Our customers often initially adopt our platform for a specific use case and subsequently increase their adoption as they realize the benefits and flexibility of our platform. We have been successful in expanding our existing customers’ adoption of our platform as demonstrated by our dollar-based net retention rate, which we consider an indicator of our ability to retain and expand revenue from existing customers over time. Our dollar-based net retention rate has fluctuated between approximately 120% and 130% for each of the past eleven quarters through the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2021. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, our dollar-based net retention rate declined a few percentage points below 120%. The decline was driven by the combination of slower than historical expansion in the install base and higher than expected churn. We anticipate that our dollar-based net retention rate may continue to decline and it will take several quarters before we start to see sustained improvement in our dollar-based net retention rate. Our efficient land-and-expand model has helped us accelerate adoption within our largest customers, as evidenced by our customers with over $100,000 of ARR, which was 358, 323, and 234 as of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, we saw growth in customers with greater than $1 million of ARR, which was 31, 25, and 17 as of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We define ARR as the annualized recurring revenue run-rate from all customers that are under contract with us at the end of the period or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract. Given our historical experience of customer renewals, if we are in active discussions for a renewal, we continue to include customers with expired contracts in our ARR until the customer either renews its contract or negotiations terminate without renewal. For certain customers whose revenue may fluctuate from month to month based upon their specific contractual arrangements, we calculate ARR using the annualized monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, run-rate (MRR multiplied by 12). This enables us to calculate our anticipated recurring revenue for all customers based on our packaging and licensing models, which we believe provides a more accurate view of our anticipated recurring revenue. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate by first identifying customers, or the Base Customers, in a particular quarter, or the Base Quarter. We then divide the ARR attributable to the Base Customers in the same quarter of the subsequent year, or the Comparison Quarter, by the ARR attributable to those Base Customers in the Base Quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate in a 48 particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters. Continued Investment in Technology Leadership and Innovation We intend to extend our leadership position by continuing to innovate, bringing new technologies to market, honing best practices, and driving thought leadership. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain a competitive advantage. We expect to continue to invest in research and development to increase our revenue and achieve long-term profitability, and we intend to continue extending the applicability of our platform as well as improving the value of our offerings for our customers. We believe that our platform is highly differentiated and has broad applicability to a wide variety of use cases, and we will continue to invest in developing and enhancing platform features and functionality to further extend the adoption of our platform. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses, offerings, technologies, or talent that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Once we complete acquisitions, we must successfully integrate and manage these acquisitions to realize their benefits. International Expansion We intend to continue to invest in our international operations to grow our business outside of the United States. We generated 16% of our revenue outside the United States in each of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. We believe that global demand for Continuous Intelligence and for the functionality of our platform will continue to increase as international businesses undergo digital transformations and adopt cloud-based technologies. We currently have a sales presence throughout Asia-Pacific-Japan, or APJ, and Europe, with sales offices in Sydney, Australia, Tokyo, Japan, and London, United Kingdom, and we further increase our global reach with our over 175 international channel partners. International expansion over the long term represents a significant opportunity and we plan to continue to invest in growing our presence internationally, both through expanding our sales and marketing efforts and leveraging channel and other ecosystem partners. Acquisition of Jask Labs Inc. On October 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Jask Labs, a privately-held software company that offers a cloud-native security analytics solution. The acquisition brought together our platform, including our cloud SIEM and security compliance solutions, with Jask Labs’ security analytics solution to deliver an integrated, cloud-native security intelligence solution. The aggregate purchase consideration was $55.1 million, of which $11.2 million was paid in cash, $43.3 million was comprised of 3,573,659 shares of common stock, and $0.6 million was comprised of assumed options to purchase 265,075 shares of common stock. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate subscription revenue through the sale of subscriptions to customers that enable them to access our cloud-native platform. Subscription terms are generally one year, but can be three years or longer, and a substantial majority of our contracts are non-cancelable. Subscription revenue is driven by sales of our multi-tiered paid subscriptions, the pricing for which differs based on a variety of factors, including volume of data expected to be ingested, duration of data retention, and breadth of access to our platform features and functionalities. Due to the ease of using our platform, professional services revenue from configuration, implementation, and training services constituted less than 1% of our total revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes all direct costs to deliver and support our platform, including personnel and related costs, third-party hosting fees related to our cloud platform, amortization of internal-use software and acquired developed technology, as well as allocated facilities and IT costs. As new customers purchase access to our platform and our existing customer base expands their utilization of our platform, we will incur greater cloud hosting costs related to the increased volume of data being hosted. We will continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and customer support organizations to expand the capabilities of our platform features and ensure that our customers are realizing the full benefit of our platform. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. 49 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing and amount of investments to maintain or expand our cloud hosting capability, the continued growth of our platform and customer support teams, increased compensation expenses, as well as amortization of costs associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets. We expect our gross profit to increase and our gross margin to increase modestly over the long term due to the continued growth in the use of our platform and cost efficiencies related to our cloud hosting services, although our gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay between the factors described above. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel and related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, bonuses, sales commissions, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation expense, as well as the allocated portion of overhead costs for facilities and IT. Operating expenses also include cloud infrastructure fees and other services related to staging and development efforts for our platform. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research, design, maintenance, and minor enhancements of our platform that are expensed as incurred. These costs consist primarily of personnel and related expenses, including allocated overhead costs, contractor and consulting fees related to the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our platform, and software, hardware, and cloud infrastructure fees for staging and development related to research and development activities necessary to support growth in our employee base and in the adoption of our platform. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in dollar value as we continue to increase our investments in our platform. However, we anticipate research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenses. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses including allocated overhead costs and commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, including free trials of our platform, fees for professional services related to marketing, and software and hardware to support growth in our employee base. Sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered incremental costs of obtaining a subscription with a customer are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar value over the long term, though the dollar value of such expenses may fluctuate in the near term. We believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be our largest operating expense for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as a percentage of our revenue over the near term, but decrease over the long term, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenses. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and security, and other administrative personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include non-personnel costs, such as fees for professional services such as external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, hardware and software costs, certain taxes other than income taxes, and overhead costs not allocated to other departments. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and fees for professional services. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar value as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue as our revenue grows over the long term, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenses. 50 Interest and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest and other (expense) income, net primarily consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains (losses). Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred in connection with borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated: ____________ (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: (a) See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the incremental stock-based compensation expense related to transfers of our common stock by our current and former employees to existing investors for amounts over the estimated fair value at the date of the transaction. (b) See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the capitalized stock-based compensation expense related to internal-use software development costs. 51 (2) Includes amortization of acquired intangible assets as follows: (3) We recorded sales and marketing expenses for additional compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees of $1.5 million and $4.5 million, during the year ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for additional compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees. Of the aggregate $6.0 million, approximately $4.5 million was paid as part of a settlement agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For more information, see the section titled “Legal Proceedings.” The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue: ____________ Note: Certain figures may not sum due to rounding. Comparison of Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 Revenue Revenue increased by $47.6 million, or 31%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. This increase included an increase in revenue from our current largest revenue customer, which represented $15.2 million in revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to $10.9 million in fiscal 2020. Excluding the revenue from this customer, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 would have been 30%. We estimate that approximately 90% of the increase in revenue was attributable to growth from existing customers, and the remaining approximately 10% was attributable to new customers. In particular, the number of customers with greater than $100,000 of ARR increased to 358 as of January 31, 2021 from 323 as of January 31, 2020. 52 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased by $12.0 million, or 27%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an $8.0 million increase in third-party hosting fees, other services, and personnel costs related to providing access to and supporting our platform, and a $4.2 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily as a result of our acquisition of Jask Labs. Our gross profit increased $35.6 million while gross margin increased 1% primarily as a result of an initiative to optimize our cloud infrastructure costs and platform efficiency. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by $17.7 million, or 34%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a $18.9 million increase in personnel and related expenses associated with fluctuations in headcount, including an increase in allocated overhead costs, of which $7.8 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. This increase in personnel and related costs also included a $4.2 million decrease in capitalized internal-use software. This increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in events due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there was a $0.5 million decrease in software, hardware, and cloud infrastructure fees for staging and development as a result of an initiative to optimize our cloud infrastructure costs and platform efficiency. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 2%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by a $9.5 million increase in personnel and related expenses associated with fluctuations in headcount, including an increase in allocated overhead costs, of which $5.7 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. This increase in personnel and related costs was partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in travel related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a non-recurring $3.0 million expense related to compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees recorded during fiscal 2020. In addition, we had a $2.7 million increase related to cloud hosting fees for our customer free trials and customer proofs of value in addition to increased software costs, which was offset by a $3.7 million decrease in third-party public relations, marketing services, and professional services as a result of our annual user conference, Illuminate, being held virtually in fiscal 2021 as well as other decreased spending related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 53 General and Administ rative General and adm inistrative expenses increased by $7.1 million, or 19%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a $8.0 million increase in personnel and related expenses due to an increase in cost per head and fluctuations in headcount, of which $5.1 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. In addition, insurance, fees and property taxes increased by $2.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $3.8 million, primarily related to the acquisition-related expenses for our acquisition of Jask Labs in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Impairment of Capitalized Internal-Use Software Impairment of capitalized-internal use software was $0 for fiscal 2021 compared to $6.7 million for fiscal 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we determined that certain previously developed internal-use software would no longer be integrated with the Company’s platform due to a change in product strategy after the acquisition of Jask Labs and would no longer be placed into service. Interest and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest and other (expense) income, net decreased by $2.4 million, or 121%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease in interest and other (expense) income, net was primarily driven by a $2.3 million decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2021 also included realized foreign currency losses of $0.4 million and a loss on the fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants of $0.3 million. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $0.6 million f or fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by interest incurred on borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility in fiscal 2021, which was fully repaid in fiscal 2021. Comparison of Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 Revenue Revenue increased by $51.4 million, or 50%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. This increase included an increase in revenue from our current largest revenue customer, which represented $10.9 million in revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 54 million in fiscal 2019. Excluding the revenue from this customer, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 would have been 42%. We estimate that approximately 90% of the increase in revenue was attributable to growth from existing customers, and the remaining approximately 10% was attributable to new customers. In particular, the number of customers with greater than $100,000 of ARR increased to 323 as of January 31, 2020 from 234 as of January 31, 2019. Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased by $15.5 million, or 53%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase of $12.7 million in third-party hosting fees and other services related to providing access to and supporting our platform and an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2.3 million primarily as a result of our acquisition of Jask Labs. Our gross profit increased $35.9 million while gross margin decreased 1% primarily as a result of increased amortization of acquired intangible assets. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by $16.2 million, or 45%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by a $13.5 million increase in personnel and related expenses directly associated with an increase in headcount, including an increase in allocated overhead costs, net of an increase in capitalized internal-use software of $4.2 million, and an increase of $1.5 million in stock-based compensation related to transfers of our common stock by current employees to existing investors for amounts over the estimated fair value at the date of the transaction. In addition, we had a $2.1 million increase in software, hardware, and cloud infrastructure fees for staging and development to support the growth of the business and related infrastructure. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased by $35.0 million, or 48%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by a $28.7 million increase in personnel and related expenses directly associated with an increase in headcount, including an increase in allocated overhead costs, $0.7 million in stock-based compensation related to transfers of our common stock by current employees to existing investors for amounts over the estimated fair value at the date of the transaction, and $4.5 million of compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees. In addition, we had an increase of $4.1 million related to advertising, marketing, and promotional activities. 55 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $22.9 million, or 160%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a $13.6 million increase in personnel and related expenses directly associated with an increase in headcount, including an increase of $2.3 million in stock-based compensation related to transfers of our common stock by current and former employees to existing investors for amounts over the estimated fair value at the date of the transaction. In addition, fees for professional services increased by $8.3 million as we leveraged external legal, accounting, and other consulting services to support our growth and public company readiness initiatives, $3.0 million of which was attributed to acquisition-related expenses. Impairment of Capitalized Internal-Use Software Impairment of capitalized-internal use software was $6.7 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $0 for fiscal 2019. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we determined that certain previously developed internal-use software would no longer be integrated with the Company’s platform due to a change in product strategy after the acquisition of Jask Labs and would no longer be placed into service. Interest and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest and other (expense) income, net increased by $0.9 million, or 81%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in interest and other (expense) income, net was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $1.3 million from our cash and cash equivalents balance. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. 56 Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as gross profit and gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded to cost of revenue and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP Operating Loss and Non-GAAP Operating Margin We define non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin as loss from operations and operating margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and impairment of capitalized internal-use software. 57 Non-GAAP Net Loss We define non-GAAP net loss as loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and impairment of capitalized internal-use software. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors, and investors with information about our future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet and further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. 58 Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated results of operations for each of the quarters indicated. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared in accordance with GAAP on the same basis as our audited annual consolidated financial statements and includes, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations to be expected for any future period. _______________ (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: (2) Includes amortization of acquired intangible assets as follows: 59 (3) During the three months ended April 30, 2020 and three months ended October 31, 2019, we recorded sales and marketing expenses of $1.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for additional compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees. Of the aggregate $6.0 million, approximately $4.5 million was paid as part of a settlement agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For more information, see the section titled “Business—Legal Proceedings.” All values from the statements of operations, expressed as percentage of revenue, were as follows: ______________ Note: Certain figures may not sum due to rounding. Quarterly Revenue Trends Our quarterly revenue increased sequentially in each of the periods presented above due primarily to increases in the number of customers purchasing our subscriptions as well as additional sales to existing customers. We generally experience seasonality based on when we enter into agreements with customers, which has historically been the most frequent in our fourth quarter, and our quarterly results of operations generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customer buying habits. This seasonality is reflected to a lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in revenue due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription. Quarterly Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin Trends Our quarterly cost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margins fluctuate based on timing of our investments in our platform infrastructure and customer support personnel to support the growth in our customer base. Subsequent to January 31, 2020, our gross margin has generally increased each quarter primarily as a result of an initiative to optimize our cloud infrastructure costs and platform efficiencies. During the quarter ended January 31, 2020, our gross margin decreased as a result of an increase in third-party hosting fees and other services related to providing access to and supporting our platform and an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily due to the acquisition of Jask Labs. We will continue to invest in third-party hosting infrastructure and our customer support organizations to expand the capability of our platform and ensure that our customers are realizing the full benefit of our offerings. Quarterly Operating Expense Trends In general, our sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses have increased over the periods presented above as we increased our headcount to support growth and expansion in the business. Our total operating expenses increased during the three months ended October 31, 2020, due to a cumulative stock-based compensation charge of $10.9 million related to the liquidity event performance-based vesting condition was deemed probable of occurring, for our outstanding RSUs, during the quarter. Our total operating expenses decreased during the three months ended July 31, 2020, primarily as a result of lower overall expenses due to the reduction in headcount and slowdown in events, travel, and marketing spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the three months ended April 30, 2020, we recorded an additional $1.5 million in sales and marketing expenses for compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees. During the three months 60 ended October 31, 2019, we recorded $4.5 million in sales and marketing expenses for compensation and other costs related to the employment status of certain current and former employees. During each of the periods presented below, current and former employees made transfers of our common stock for amounts over the estimated fair value at the date of the transaction. We recorded stock-based compensation expense for these transfers as shown in the table below. Quarterly Non-GAAP Results of Operations Data The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin to the most comparable GAAP measures, gross profit and gross margin, respectively, for each of the periods presented. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a description of the non-GAAP measures and their limitations as an analytical tool. The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP operating margin to the most comparable GAAP measures, operating loss and operating margin, respectively, for each of the periods presented: 61 The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss to the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for each of the periods presented: The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, cash used in operating activities, for each of the periods presented: Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through subscription revenue from customers accessing our cloud-native platform and the net proceeds of issuances of equity securities. We have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $397.8 million as of January 31, 2021. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we received net proceeds of $342.7 million, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and offering costs of $31.8 million, including the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. As of January 31, 2021, we had $404.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by sales of access to our platform will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months, despite the uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have an impact on our available cash due to customer requests for extended payment terms or better pricing. As a result of our revenue growth plans, both domestically and internationally, we expect that losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue in the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, subscription renewals, billing timing and frequency, pricing changes, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced platform features and functionality, the continued market adoption of our platform, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations, the business of our customers, and the economy. We may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets, and talent. In February 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or the SVB Agreement. Such SVB Agreement amends and restates the Loan Agreement dated as of January 31, 2016. Under the SVB Agreement, we can borrow up to $50 million. Interest on any drawdown under the revolving line of credit in the SVB Agreement accrues at the prime rate minus a spread rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, as determined by our adjusted quick ratio, subject to either a 3.00% or 2.50% floor depending on the adjusted quick ratio. The SVB Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and includes restrictive covenants, in each case subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt, grant liens, make acquisitions, suffer changes in control, make investments, make certain dividends or distributions, repurchase or redeem stock, dispose of or transfer assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Pursuant to the SVB Agreement, we are also required to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of 1.25 to 1.00. The SVB Agreement also contains customary events of default, upon which 62 Silicon Valley Bank may declare all or a portion of our outstanding obligations payable to be immediately due and payable. As of January 31, 2021, we did not have any debt balance outstanding. We typically invoice our subscription customers annually in advance, and in certain cases, we invoice upfront for multi-year contracts. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of January 31, 2021, future estimated revenue related to performance obligations from non-cancelable contracts that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $252.3 million, of which we expect to recognize revenue of $151.9 million over the next 12 months, with the remaining balance recognized thereafter. As of January 31, 2021, we had deferred revenue of $106.7 million, of which $102.6 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months, subject to applicable revenue recognition criteria. Cash Flows The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented: Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from sales of subscriptions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel and related expenses, marketing expenses, and third-party hosting and software costs. In the last several years, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities and have supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds from equity financings. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2021 of $47.2 million consisted of our net loss of $80.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $61.4 million and net cash outflows of $28.2 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $41.0 million, amortization of deferred sales commissions of $11.5 million, and depreciation and amortization of $8.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected a $25.8 million increase in deferred sales commissions due to commissions paid on new bookings, a $17.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to new billings outpacing collections during the period and a $6.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets related to the timing of payments to vendors and amortization of prior amounts paid. These amounts were partially offset by a $18.0 million increase in deferred revenue resulting from increased billings for subscriptions, a $2.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments to vendors, and a $1.3 million increase in other liabilities for payroll taxes, which were deferred under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2020 of $48.6 million consisted of our net loss of $92.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $42.4 million and net cash inflows of $1.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $22.0 million, amortization of deferred sales commissions of $8.8 million, impairment of capitalized internal-use software of $6.7 million, and depreciation and amortization of $4.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected a $19.9 million increase in deferred revenue resulting from increased billings for subscriptions and a $7.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments to vendors. These amounts were partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in deferred sales commissions due to commissions paid on new bookings and a $9.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to billings outpacing collections during the period. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2019 of $22.1 million consisted of our net loss of $47.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $15.9 million and net cash inflows of $9.8 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of amortization of deferred sales commissions of $7.0 million, stock-based compensation of $6.6 million, and depreciation and amortization of $2.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected a $21.1 million increase in deferred revenue resulting from increased billings for subscriptions, which was partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in deferred sales commissions due to commissions paid on new bookings. 63 Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 of $2.3 million consisted of $1.2 million of capitalized internal-use software costs and $1.1 million in purchases of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture for our expanded office space and computers for new employees. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 of $23.4 million consisted of $15.7 million in cash paid in connection with acquisitions of privately-held companies net of cash and restricted cash acquired, $5.6 million of capitalized internal-use software costs, and $2.1 million in purchases of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture and computers for new employees. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 of $1.5 million consisted of capitalized internal-use software costs of $1.1 million and $0.5 million in purchases of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture and computers for new employees. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 of $352.0 million primarily consisted of proceeds from the completion of our IPO of $349.2 million, net of underwriting discounts, and proceeds from common stock option exercises of $7.3 million, partially offset by $4.4 million in payments of deferred offering costs associated with our IPO. We also borrowed and repaid the outstanding balance under the SVB Agreement. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 of $108.1 million consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock of $106.1 million and proceeds from common stock option exercises of $4.1 million, partially offset by $2.0 million in payments of deferred offering costs associated with our IPO. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2019 of $1.7 million primarily consisted of proceeds from common stock option exercises of $1.8 million. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 31, 2021: The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. As of January 31, 2021, our unrecognized tax benefits were $4.2 million, all of which are netted against deferred tax assets. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments, if any, in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits. As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above. Indemnification Agreements In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters. Some of these indemnification provisions do not provide for a maximum potential amount of future payments we could be obligated to make. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements, and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows. 64 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepared our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in accordance with GAAP. In preparation of these consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and may involve subjective or significant judgment by management; therefore, actual results could differ from the estimated made by management. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which are disclosed below. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from contracts with customers using the five-step method described in Note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions to customers that enable them to access our cloud-native platform. Our subscription arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of our cloud-native platform at any time and as a result are accounted for as service arrangements. Revenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Subscription terms are generally one year, but can be three years or longer, and the substantial majority of our contracts are non-cancelable. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. We typically bill for subscriptions annually in advance for subscriptions with terms of one year or more. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on a range of actual prices charged to customers. In general, we satisfy the majority of our performance obligations over time as we transfer the promised services to our customers. We review the contract terms and conditions to evaluate the timing and amount of revenue recognition, the related contract balances, and our remaining performance obligations. These evaluations require judgment that could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized. Deferred Sales Commissions Deferred contract costs include sales commissions which are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit, determined to be five years. The period of benefit is estimated by considering factors such as the expected life of our subscription contracts, historical customer attrition rates, technological life of our platform, the impact of competition in our industry, as well as other factors. Amounts anticipated to be recognized within 12 months of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred sales commissions, current, with the remaining portion recorded as deferred sales commissions, noncurrent, on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs is recorded as sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Stock-Based Compensation We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards granted to employees, directors, and non-employees based on the estimated fair values on the date of the grant. The fair value of options granted and purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of our underlying common stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes was determined considering objective and subjective factors, including valuations from third-party valuation experts, and required judgment to determine the fair value of common stock for financial reporting purposes as of the date of each equity grant or modification. 65 These assumptions are estimated as follows: Fair Value. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of common stock underlying the stock options had historically been determined by our Board of Directors, with input from our management. Our Board of Directors previously determined the fair value of the common stock at the time of grant of the options by considering a number of objective and subjective factors. Subsequent to our IPO, the fair value of the underlying common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of our common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq. Expected Term . The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of these awards. Volatility. Since we do not have a trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility is based on a calculation using the historical stock information of companies deemed comparable to us, over a period equal to the expected term. We intend to apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. Risk-Free Rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant corresponding to the expected life of the award. Dividend Yield. We have not and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock-based awards and our ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the service period, net of actual forfeitures. We also have certain options and RSUs that have performance-based vesting conditions; stock-based compensation expense for such awards is recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time the vesting condition is probable through the time the vesting condition has been achieved. Prior to our IPO, we recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs on an accelerated attribution method as the RSUs were subject to service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, which included a liquidity event condition, and in certain cases, the achievement of certain other performance metrics. None of the RSUs would vest unless the liquidity event condition was satisfied. Upon the completion of the IPO, the liquidity event condition was considered probable and we recognized cumulative stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method related to RSUs that had vested as of the IPO. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. All service-based RSUs granted after after the IPO, under the 2020 stock plan, will not be subject to a liquidity event condition and will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. We adopted ASU No. 2018-07 effective February 1, 2020, which aligns the accounting for employee and non-employee awards except for inputs to the option pricing model and the attribution of cost. Assumptions used in valuing non-employee stock options are generally consistent with those used for employee stock options with the exception that the expected term is over the contractual life, or 10 years for non-employee stock options. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of February 1, 2020, the awards issued to non-employees are no longer subject to periodic adjustments as such awards vest at the end of each reporting period. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information about the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. JOBS Act Accounting Election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. 66 As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.",
