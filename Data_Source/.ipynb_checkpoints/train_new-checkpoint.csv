"You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (""Annual Report""). This Annual Report contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the MD&amp;A are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to several factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report. See ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-looking Statements."" OVERVIEW 27 Teradata Corporation is a leading multi-cloud data warehouse platform provider focused on helping companies leverage their data across an enterprise to uncover real-time intelligence, at scale. In doing so, we enable companies to find answers to their toughest business challenges. Our platform enables customers to integrate and simplify their multi-cloud data and analytic ecosystems, streamline access and management of their data, and use analytics to derive business value from diverse data types. Our platform is composed of our data warehouse platform – Teradata Vantage – enabled to run across on-premises, private cloud and public cloud environments. This platform is supported by business consulting and support services that enable customers to extract insights from across a company’s entire data and analytics ecosystem. Teradata’s strategy is discussed under Part I, Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To drive operational excellence within Teradata, we are in the process of realigning and streamlining our operations as we pursue our business transformation and strategy to become a cloud-first growth company. As part of these activities, on November 2, 2020, the Company approved a plan to realign and reduce its workforce and rationalize its real estate footprint. The workforce measures involved involuntary headcount reduction actions. Separately, in September 2020, we offered a voluntary separation program (""VSP"") to specific tenured employees as part of our efforts to improve our cost structure. For more information regarding the VSP, see Note 16 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The rationalization of the Company’s real estate footprint involves terminating leases relating to certain of the Company’s offices globally and transitioning impacted employees to a permanent virtual working environment, co-working space or facility, depending on business need. This is also consistent with the industry trend of working from a home-hybrid model. We are continuing to execute on our key priorities, including significant product expansion of our Teradata Vantage multi-cloud data warehouse platform offering, expanding our footprint with existing customers and adding net new customers, increasing our focus on diversity and inclusiveness, and driving operational excellence and agility across the company. To allow for greater transparency regarding the progress we are making toward achieving our strategic objectives, we utilize the following financial and performance metrics: • Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") - annual contract value for all active and contractually binding term-based contracts at the end of a period. ARR includes maintenance, software upgrade rights, public cloud and on-premises subscription-based transactions and managed services. • Public cloud ARR (included within total ARR) - annual contract value for all active and contractually binding term based contracts at the end of a period that are operated in a public cloud environment; and • Remaining performance obligation (""RPO"")/Backlog - the price of firm orders for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered and the Company is contractually required to perform. COVID-19 Update During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus have impacted our business globally, and we expect our business will continue to be impacted for the foreseeable future. In particular, the outbreak and related preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19 beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 negatively impacted our ability to close transactions with customers and timely collect receivables in certain instances, which impacted our revenue and cash flow results for the first quarter. However, during the back half of 2020, we recovered from this impact, and as a result, we experienced a more favorable trend with meaningful ARR growth, strong cash flows and recurring revenue growth generated in these quarters, although we continued to see COVID-19 negatively impact our consulting business as described below. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions to manage expenses and costs appropriately in light of the uncertainty COVID-19 has created, which has had a positive impact on our operating performance. We continue to keep a watchful eye on COVID-19 impacts to our business and have undertaken additional expense management and cost measures to further drive our operating performance and provide agility in the event of an unforeseen reduction in demand should it occur. During 2020, we also experienced increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, in part related to the uncertainty from COVID-19, as well as actions taken by governments and 28 central banks in response to COVID-19. Certain foreign currency rates have depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar during this period. We expect continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in 2021. Our supply chain has been relatively stable with respect to manufacturing and distribution capabilities; however, our supply chain is susceptible to volatility due to ongoing uncertainty as a result of ongoing international and domestic pandemic response and recovery efforts. Operationally, we have been able to run our business without significant interruptions, with the vast majority of employees having shifted quickly as of mid-March 2020 to a work-from-home model, which remains in effect. However, our consulting business has been negatively impacted during the transition to work from home and shelter-in-place orders. Our customers’ reduction in discretionary spending in light of COVID-19 uncertainties has also impacted our consulting business, with consulting projects being delayed or suspended by our customers. We implemented several employee engagement and communication programs designed to support employees’ health and well-being while also enhancing their productivity during the pandemic. Our priorities in formulating and implementing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruption include the following: • People - protecting the health and well-being of our employees, • Customers - proactively connecting with our customers to support their needs and meet our service level commitments, while continuing to help them gain real business value from their data assets, • Supply Chain - proactively working to monitor existing inventory, supplier availability and securing inventory for future quarters, • Financial - responsibly managing expenses and costs to provide financial agility during the extended period of global economic uncertainty, • Global Community - making our technology available to customers, partners and communities, particularly in healthcare and government, where collectively we can positively impact efforts in combating COVID-19, and • Future of Work - planning to best position the Company to emerge as strong as possible when the COVID-19 pandemic ends. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are continuing to execute our pandemic response plan, and the Teradata Pandemic Response Team is refining and executing return-to-office plans with ""safety first"" considerations. Customer-facing teams are also proactively working to identify ways to assist customers, meet service level commitments, and engage with customers via virtual events. Despite these efforts, there remains a fair degree of uncertainty regarding the potential impact of the pandemic on our business, from both a financial and operational perspective, and the scope and costs associated with additional measures that may be necessary in response to the pandemic going forward. We will continue our diligent efforts to monitor and respond as appropriate to the impacts of the pandemic on our business, including the status of our workforce, supply chain, customers, suppliers, and vendors, based on the priorities described above. Our actions will continue to be informed by the requirements and recommendations of the federal, state or local authorities. We will remain agile and have contingency plans in place to appropriately respond to conditions as they unfold. For more information, see ""Risk Factors"" under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 2020 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW As more fully discussed in later sections of this MD&amp;A, the following are the financial highlights for 2020: • Revenue of $1,836 million decreased by 3% in 2020 as compared to 2019, with an underlying 7% increase in recurring revenue primarily driven by our transition from perpetual to subscription-based transactions. The increase in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 31% decrease in perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and a 28% decrease in consulting services revenue. The decline in consulting service revenue is in alignment with our strategy as well as due to the impact of COVID-19 as discussed above. 29 • Gross margin was 55.5% in 2020, an increase from 50.3% in 2019, primarily due to a higher recurring revenue mix as compared to the prior year. • Operating expenses in 2020 increased by 6% as compared to 2019, primarily due to expenses related to the VSP offered to employees, an increase in investments in cloud transformation, and employee stock-based compensation expense. • Operating income was $16 million in 2020, up from $10 million in 2019. • Net income was $129 million in 2020 versus a net loss of $20 million in 2019, primarily due to discrete tax items. Net earnings per share was $1.16 in 2020 compared to net loss per share of $0.18 in 2019. RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018 In July 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-07, ""Codification Updates to SEC Sections-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification"", which makes a number of changes meant to simplify certain disclosures in financial condition and results of operations, particularly by eliminating year-to-year comparisons between prior periods previously disclosed. In accordance with the relevant aspects of the rule covering the current year annual report, we now include disclosures on results of operations for fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 only. For discussion of fiscal year 2019 versus 2018 see ""Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue 2020 compared to 2019 -Total revenue decreased $63 million, or 3%, in 2020. Recurring revenue grew 7%, primarily driven by our movement to subscription-based transactions from perpetual software licenses and hardware transactions, consistent with our strategy. Under subscription models, we recognize revenue over time as opposed to the upfront recognition under the perpetual model. Better than expected ARR growth also contributed to the increase in recurring revenue. For full year 2021, we expect ARR growth and recurring revenue growth at a mid- to high-single digit percentage increase as compared to 2020. Public cloud ARR is expected to increase by at least 100% year-over-year. Taking into consideration the growth in recurring revenue offset by reduced perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and reduced consulting services revenue, we expect that total revenue is expected to grow at a low-single-digit percentage in 2021 as compared to 2020. Revenues from perpetual software licenses and hardware decreased 31% in 2020 as customers continue to transition to subscription-based offerings. Consulting services revenue decreased 28%, as we are realigning and focusing our consulting resources on higher-margin engagements that drive increased software consumption within our targeted customer base. Consulting revenue was also impacted by the transition to work from home and shelter-in-place orders that went in effect late in the first quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19 as well as delays and/or cancellations of consulting projects due to customers’ reduced spending in light of COVID-19. As a portion of the Company’s operations and revenue occur outside the United States, and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Based on currency rates as of January 31, 2020, Teradata is expecting two percentage points of positive impact from currency translation on our 2021 full-year total revenues. Included below are financial and performance growth metrics for 2020: 30 • ARR was $1.587 billion at the end of 2020, a 11% increase from $1.427 billion at the end of 2019 • Public cloud ARR was $106 million at the end of 2020, a 165% increase from $40 million at the end of 2019 • Total backlog grew 7% to $2.921 billion Our ARR is composed of three main categories: (1) ARR related to subscription and public cloud software licenses, (2) ARR related to our legacy perpetual maintenance and software upgrade rights, and (3) ARR related to subscription-based managed services. At December 31, 2020, our ARR consisted of: • $960 million of subscription and public cloud-related ARR, up 37%; • $508 million of perpetual license maintenance and software upgrade rights-related ARR, down 17%; and • $119 million of subscription-based managed services ARR, up 6%. This decline in our maintenance and software upgrade-related ARR, compared to 2019 was expected as the Company completes its transition to a subscription model and customers increasingly purchase Teradata on a subscription and/or public cloud basis. The rate of our transition to a recurring revenue model has been significantly faster than expected, and we believe it is reflective of the value our customers see in our subscription model and cloud offerings. Teradata will be realigning its ARR and revenue disclosures beginning the first quarter of 2021, removing managed services and third-party software from subscription-based ARR and recurring revenue. Managed services revenue will be included in ""Consulting services revenue"" in 2021 and third-party software will be moved to ""Perpetual software licenses, hardware and other revenue."" Gross Profit The Company often uses specific terms and definitions to describe variances in gross profit. The terms and definitions most often used are as follows: • Revenue Mix - The proportion of recurring, consulting, and perpetual software licenses and hardware that generates the total revenue of the Company. Changes in revenue mix can have an impact on gross profit even if total revenue remains unchanged. • Recurring Revenue Mix - The proportion of various recurring revenue offerings that comprise the total of recurring revenue. For example, a higher mix of subscriptions including hardware rentals could have a negative impact on total recurring gross profit. • Deal Mix - Refers to the type of transactions closed within the period that generate the total perpetual software license and hardware revenue. For example, a higher mix of hardware versus software or the mix of Teradata versus third-party products can impact profitability. Gross profit for the following years ended December 31 was as follows: 2020 compared to 2019 - The decrease in recurring gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by a higher mix of subscription-based revenue as compared to the prior-year period. Subscription-based transactions 31 are typically lower margin as compared to the recurring revenue from legacy software maintenance and software upgrade rights, due to the higher mix of rental hardware. The increase in perpetual software licenses and hardware gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by deal mix as compared to the prior year. Consulting services gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to improved resource mix utilization as well as increased price realization and our continued strategic focus to improve consulting margins. The Company continues to refocus our consulting organization on Vantage-oriented offerings and reduce our footprint in non-core consulting engagements. As part of our restructuring actions, we have moved to a more variable consulting cost structure starting in 2021, which is designed to improve the profitability of our consulting business. Operating Expenses 2020 compared to 2019 - The SG&amp;A expense increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation expense, the VSP, amortization of capitalized sales compensation, as well as additional investments in our go-to-market and customer success teams. R&amp;D expenses increased primarily due to the VSP and a re-prioritization of our R&amp;D organization on strategic initiatives and reduced spending on de-prioritized initiatives, while increasing investments in Cloud transformations. Other Expense, net Other expense, net in 2020 and 2019 is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt and finance leases, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as benefit costs for our pension and postemployment plans. Other expense, net increased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower interest income generated on investments due to lower invested balances and lower interest rates, increased benefit costs for our pension and postemployment plans, and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the following years ended December 31 was as follows: The 2020 effective tax rate included a net $157 million of discrete tax benefit. Discrete tax benefit of $157 million, was recorded related to the transfer of foreign intellectual property as more fully described below. In addition, the Company recognized a net $13 million of tax benefit resulting from the CARES Act of 2020, which allows U.S. 32 corporations a one-time opportunity to claim income tax refunds by allowing a 5-year net operating loss (""NOL"") carry-back for taxable losses incurred in the tax year 2020. Teradata intends to carry back its 2020 NOL to claim a refund for taxes it paid in 2015, which created a one-time income tax benefit for the difference between the 35% 2015 carry back tax rate and the current 21% federal statutory rate. These tax benefits were partially offset by $9 million tax expense related to stock-based compensation and $4 million of incremental global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") tax. These discrete net tax benefits resulted in full-year total income tax benefit in 2020 of $153 million, on a pre-tax net loss of $24 million, causing a tax rate of 637.5%. The 2019 effective tax rate was impacted by $3 million tax expense related to stock-based compensation and $3 million of incremental GILTI tax, which resulted in a full-year income tax expense in 2019 of $7 million, on a pre-tax net loss of $13 million, causing a negative tax rate of 53.8%. The Company is expecting its full-year effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 29%, which takes into consideration, among other things, the forecasted earnings mix by jurisdiction and the estimated discrete items to be recognized in 2021. The forecasted tax rate is based on the overseas profits being taxed at an overall effective tax rate of approximately 23%, as compared to the federal statutory tax rate of 21% in the U.S. Revenue and Gross Profit by Operating Segment Teradata manages its business under three geographic regions, which are also the Company’s operating segments: (1) Americas region (North America and Latin America); (2) EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and (3) APJ region (Asia Pacific and Japan). For purposes of discussing results by segment, management excludes the impact of certain items, consistent with the manner by which management evaluates the performance of each segment. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends. It also includes the same information that is used by Teradata management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess financial performance. The chief operating decision maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the segments based on revenue and multiple profit measures, including segment gross profit. For management reporting purposes, assets are not allocated to the segments. Our segment results are reconciled to total company results reported under GAAP in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents revenue and operating performance by segment for the years ended December 31: 2020 compared to 2019 Americas Americas revenue decreased 3% and included a 1% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. An increase in recurring revenue of 1% was offset by a decrease of 5% in perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and a decrease in consulting revenue of 27%. Segment gross profit as a percentage of revenues was higher primarily due to an overall higher mix of recurring revenue. EMEA 33 EMEA revenue decreased 1%, which included a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. An increase of 19% in recurring revenue was offset by a decrease of 47% in perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and a decrease in consulting revenue of 31%. Segment gross profit as a percentage of revenues was higher primarily due to a higher mix of recurring revenue. APJ APJ revenue decreased 7%, which included no impact from foreign currency fluctuations. An increase in recurring revenue of 11% was offset by a decrease of 44% in perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and a decrease in consulting revenue of 24%. Segment gross profit as a percentage of revenues was higher primarily due to a higher mix of recurring revenue. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Teradata ended 2020 with $529 million in cash and cash equivalents, a $35 million increase from the December 31, 2019 balance, after using approximately $100 million for repurchases of Company common stock during the year. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $119 million to $267 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Teradata used approximately $58 million of cash in 2020 for reorganizing and restructuring its operations and go-to-market functions to align to its strategy, as compared to $63 million in 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved management of working capital. Although the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial results for 2020, we have reviewed our capital projects to ensure that we are only spending on projects that are deemed to be essential in the current environment. We have taken steps to manage spending on travel, third-party services and other operating expenses, and we continue to focus on cash flow generation. Terms of payments have been extended for certain customers in impacted industries; however, these extensions are not significant in aggregate. We do not expect the pandemic to have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity, as we believe that operating cash flows and available liquidity are sufficient to support operational needs for at least the next 12 months. Teradata’s management uses a non-GAAP measure called ""free cash flow,"" which is not a measure defined under GAAP. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. Free cash flow is one measure of assessing the financial performance of the Company, and this may differ from the definition used by other companies. The components that are used to calculate free cash flow are GAAP measures taken directly from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe that free cash flow information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in the Company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and repurchase of Teradata common stock. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities under GAAP. The table below shows net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following periods: Financing activities and certain other investing activities are not included in our calculation of free cash flow. There were no other investing activities in 2020 and 2019. Teradata’s financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $100 million for share repurchases, repayment of existing term loan of $25 million and $70 million of payments on finance leases, partially offset by $9 million net inflows from other financing activities. 34 Teradata’s financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $300 million for share repurchases, repayment of existing term loan of $19 million and $33 million of payments on finance leases, partially offset by $44 million net inflows from other financing activities. The Company purchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $20.81 in 2020 and 8.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $35.38 in 2019. Share repurchases were made under two share repurchase programs initially authorized by our Board of Directors in 2008. The first of these programs (the ""dilution offset program"") authorizes the Company to repurchase Teradata common stock to the extent of cash received from the exercise of stock options and the Teradata Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") to offset dilution from shares issued pursuant to these plans. As of December 31, 2020, under the Company’s second share repurchase program (the ""general share repurchase program""), the Company had approximately $416 million of authorization remaining to repurchase outstanding shares of Teradata common stock. Share repurchases made by the Company are reported on a trade date basis. Proceeds from the ESPP and the exercise of stock options, net of tax paid for shares withheld upon equity award settlement, were $9 million in 2020 and $44 million in 2019. These proceeds are included in other financing activities, net in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our total cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries was $342 million as of December 31, 2020 and $344 million as of December 31, 2019. The remaining balance held in the United States was $191 million as of December 31, 2020 and $150 million as of December 31, 2019. Prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company either reinvested or intended to reinvest its earnings outside of the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company has changed its indefinite reinvestment assertion related to foreign earnings that have been taxed in the United States and now considers a majority of these earnings no longer indefinitely reinvested. Effective January 1, 2018, the United States moved to a territorial system of international taxation, and as such will generally not subject future foreign earnings to United States taxation upon repatriation in future years. Management believes current cash, cash generated from operations and the $400 million available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy future working capital, research and development activities, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company principally holds its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and highly-rated money market funds. The Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, competitive pressures, and other business and risk factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise to comply with the terms of the credit facility and term loan agreement, the Company may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. Long-term Debt . Our long-term debt and minimum debt obligations as of December 31, 2020 are discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Leases. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into operating and finance leases that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. Leases and minimum lease obligations as of December 31, 2020 are described in detail in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Other Commercial Commitments. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. The following table and discussion outline our material obligations at December 31, 2020, with projected cash payments in the periods shown: 35 Transition tax is the remaining payable balance as of December 31, 2020 of the one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Act. The payments associated with this deemed repatriation will be paid over seven years ending in 2025. Purchase obligations are committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods and services and include non-cancelable contractual payments for fixed or minimum amounts to be purchased in relation to service agreements with various vendors for ongoing telecommunications, information technology, hosting and other services. Additionally, the Company had $39 million in total uncertain tax positions recorded on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, of which $18 million is recorded in non-current liabilities and $21 million is reflected as an offset to deferred tax assets related to certain tax attribute carryforwards. These items are not included in the table of obligations shown above. The settlement period for the non-current income tax liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing and the amount of the payments, if any, will depend on possible future tax examinations with the various tax authorities. However, it is not expected that any payments will be due within the next 12 months. We also have product warranties and guarantees to third parties, as well as postemployment and international pension obligations that may affect future cash flow. These items are not included in the table of obligations shown above. The Company is also potentially subject to concentration of supplier risk. Our hardware components are assembled exclusively by Flex Ltd. (""Flex""). Flex procures a wide variety of components used in the manufacturing process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost, and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure continuity of supply. Given the Company’s strategy to outsource its manufacturing activities to Flex and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flex or at a supplier could impact the timing of customer shipments and/or Teradata’s operating results. In addition, a significant change in the forecasts to any of these preferred suppliers could result in purchase obligations or components that may be in excess of demand. Product warranties and third-party guarantees are described in detail in ""Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Postemployment and pension obligations are described in detail in ""Note 8—Employee Benefit Plans"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting policies are those that require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Our management periodically reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require significant management judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. The significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below. Teradata’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of Teradata’s Board of Directors. For additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP, see ""Note 1— 36 Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASC 606""). This standard replaced existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. Refer to Notes 1 and 3, of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires judgment, including a review of specific contracts, past experience, creditworthiness of customers, international laws and other factors. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. We must also apply judgment in determining all performance obligations in the contract and in determining the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, considering the price charged for each product when sold on a standalone basis and applicable renewal rates for services and subscriptions. Changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods. The Company reviews the standalone selling price on a periodic basis and updates it, when appropriate, to ensure that the practices employed reflect the Company’s recent pricing experience. The Company maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates, which includes review and approval by the Company’s management. For the year ended December 31, 2020 there was no material impact to revenue resulting from changes in the standalone selling price, nor does the Company expect a material impact from such changes in the near term. Income Taxes In accounting for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. The Company made an accounting policy election in 2018 related to the Tax Act to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is i ncurred. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company had not provided for taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as the Company either reinvested or intended to reinvest those earnings outside of the United States. Because of the Tax Act, the Company has changed its indefinite reinvestment assertion related to foreign earnings that have been taxed in the United States and now considers a majority of these earnings no longer indefinitely reinvested. The Company has recorded $2 million of deferred foreign tax expense with respect to certain earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested. Deferred taxes have not been provided on earnings considered indefinitely reinvested. We account for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing thresholds and attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We record any interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a total of $39 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $18 million is included in the other liabilities section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a non-current liability. The remaining balance of $21 million of uncertain tax positions relates to certain tax attributes generated by the Company which are netted against the underlying deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have recorded $51 million in 2020 and $45 million in 2019 for valuation allowances, a majority of which offset our California R&amp;D tax credit carryfoward, as the Company expects to continue to generate excess California R&amp;D tax credits into the foreseeable future. 37 On January 1, 2020, we transferred certain of our intellectual property among our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of $157 million. The recognition of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intellectual property required us to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intellectual property. Significant assumptions in valuing the intellectual property include, but are not limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, and the discount rate. The sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of these valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities. Stock-based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period. In addition, we issue performance-based awards that vest only if specific performance conditions are satisfied. The number of shares that will be earned can vary based on actual performance. No shares will vest if the threshold objectives are not met. In the event the objectives are exceeded, additional shares will vest up to a maximum payout. The cost of these awards is expensed over the performance period based upon management’s estimate and analysis of the probability of meeting the performance criteria. Because the actual number of shares to be awarded is not known until the end of the performance period, the actual compensation expense related to these awards could differ from our current expectations. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. For 2019, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test. In this test, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company typically determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary. Determining the fair value of goodwill and acquired intangibles is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. The company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which may not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. Leases On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"", which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our material operating leases consist of automobiles in certain countries and real estate, including office, storage and parking space. Our operating leases generally have remaining terms of 2-6 years. Our finance leases primarily consist of equipment financed for the purpose of delivering services to our customers and generally have terms of 3 years. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, when available, the we use the rate implicit in the lease. However, real estate 38 leases do not typically provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the lease liability is based on the secured rate associated with financed lease obligations for each location of leased property. Many of our leases include variable rental escalation clauses which are recognized when incurred. Some of our leases also include renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into the determination of lease payments and lease terms when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise these options. Lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Changes in judgments and estimates, such as the likelihood of renewal options, impairments, or the incremental borrowing rate could impact the amounts of assets or liabilities recorded or could impact the amount of cost or expense recognized between periods. Pension and Postemployment Benefits We measure pension and postemployment benefit costs and credits using actuarial valuations. Actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans. These factors include assumptions we make about interest rates, expected investment return on plan assets, total and involuntary turnover rates, and rates of future compensation increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations. We review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. The actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the measurement of our pension and postemployment benefit obligations and to the amount of pension and postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record. For example, as of December 31, 2020, a one-half percent increase/decrease in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately $13 million, and a one-half percent increase/decrease in our involuntary turnover assumption would change our postemployment benefit obligation by approximately $9 million.

• Revenue of $1,836 million decreased by 3% in 2020 as compared to 2019, with an underlying 7% increase in recurring revenue primarily driven by the company's transition from perpetual to subscription-based transactions. The increase in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 31% decrease in perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and a 28% decrease in consulting services revenue. The decline in consulting service revenue is in alignment with the company's strategy as well as due to the impact of COVID-19 as discussed above.
• Gross margin was 55.5% in 2020, an increase from 50.3% in 2019, primarily due to a higher recurring revenue mix as compared to the prior year.
• Operating expenses in 2020 increased by 6% as compared to 2019, primarily due to expenses related to the VSP offered to employees, an increase in investments in cloud transformation, and employee stock-based compensation expense.
• Operating income was $16 million in 2020, up from $10 million in 2019.
•Net income was $129 million in 2020 versus a net loss of $20 million in 2019, primarily due to discrete tax items. Net earnings per share was $1.16 in 2020 compared to net loss per share of $0.18
Total revenue decreased $63 million, or 3%, in 2020. Recurring revenue grew 7%, primarily driven by the company’s movement to subscription-based transactions from perpetual software licenses and hardware transactions, consistent with the company's strategy. Under subscription models, the company recognizes revenue over time as opposed to the upfront recognition under the perpetual model. Better than expected ARR growth also contributed to the increase in recurring revenue. For full year 2021, the company expects ARR growth and recurring revenue growth at a mid- to high-single digit percentage increase as compared to 2020. Public cloud ARR is expected to increase by at least 100% year-over-year. Taking into consideration the growth in recurring revenue offset by reduced perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and reduced consulting services revenue, the company expects that total revenue is expected to grow at a low-single-digit percentage in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Revenues from perpetual software licenses and hardware decreased 31% in 2020 as customers continue to transition to subscription-based offerings.
Consulting services revenue decreased 28%, as the company is realigning and focusing the company's consulting resources on higher-margin engagements that drive increased software consumption within the company's targeted customer base. Consulting revenue was also impacted by the transition to work from home and shelter-in-place orders that went in effect late in the first quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19 as well as delays and/or cancellations of consulting projects due to customers’ reduced spending in light of COVID-19.
The decrease in recurring gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by a higher mix of subscription-based revenue as compared to the prior-year period. Subscription-based transactions are typically lower margin as compared to the recurring revenue from legacy software maintenance and software upgrade rights, due to the higher mix of rental hardware.
The increase in perpetual software licenses and hardware gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by deal mix as compared to the prior year.
Consulting services gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to improved resource mix utilization as well as increased price realization and the company's continued strategic focus to improve consulting margins. The Company continues to refocus the company's consulting organization on Vantage-oriented offerings and reduce the company's footprint in non-core consulting engagements.
As part of the company’s restructuring actions, the company has moved to a more variable consulting cost structure starting in 2021, which is designed to improve the profitability of its consulting business.
Teradata ended 2020 with $529 million in cash and cash equivalents, a $35 million increase from the December 31, 2019 balance, after using approximately $100 million for repurchases of Company common stock during the year. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $119 million to $267 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Teradata used approximately $58 million of cash in 2020 for reorganizing and restructuring its operations and go-to-market functions to align to its strategy, as compared to $63 million in 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved management of working capital.
Teradata’s financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $100 million for share repurchases, repayment of existing term loan of $25 million and $70 million of payments on finance leases, partially offset by $9 million net inflows from other financing activities.
The Company purchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $20.81 in 2020 and 8.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $35.38 in 2019. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into operating and finance leases that impact, or could impact, its liquidity.

"In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&amp;A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&amp;A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Information provided in the MD&amp;A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business during the year ended March 31, 2021. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The pandemic could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could continue to negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the ongoing collection of accounts receivable from our customers. During our fiscal 2021, we reduced discretionary costs through actions including hiring freezes on non-essential positions, layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. While we have eased certain cost reduction measures recently, we may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare.

Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to 23 existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, turning profitable and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue – Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 24 Results of Operations Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: 25 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Net revenue. Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 39.6%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 15.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue sales were led by our add on software modules, including modules enabling social distancing and contactless capabilities. Professional services revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 33.3%, due to delays in implementation services due to customer property restrictions, property closures and lower sales from delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 10.4%, in fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.4% to 65.2%. Products gross profit increased $5.4 million and gross profit margin increased from 17.6% to 49.4% driven mostly by the absence of software development cost amortization during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $6.1 million and gross profit margin increased 269 basis points to 79.7% due to increased subscription revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $3.1 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.5% to 25.5% due to the delay in professional service projects and the fixed costs of maintaining a minimum required professional services team as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations and accept implementations and installations. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments, severance and other charges, increased $16.8 million, or 18.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 22.0% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $13.9 million, or 33.5%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to the continued expansion of our R&amp;D teams and significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. 26 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing de creased $ 5.7 million, or 28.5 %, in fiscal 20 2 1 compared with fiscal 20 20 due to reduced commission expense as a result of lower sales levels, significantly reduced travel, layoffs, temporary reductions in employee benefits, and the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity . The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in stock-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs . General and administrative. General and administrative increased $9.0 million, or 37.0%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The change is due primarily to significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.3 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.6 million or 22.9% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal 2020. Impairments. There were no impairments in fiscal 2021. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. The impairments resulted from specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the impacted solutions at the time of impairment determination. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero during the 2020 fiscal year. Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges increased $1.9 million due to an increase in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters. Other (Income) Expenses nm – not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate-owned life insurance policies and interest-bearing bank accounts. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense, net. Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes For fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including increases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 27 Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2021, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $46.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $ 165.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2022 through 2041. Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: 28 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Net revenue. Total revenue increased $19.9 million, or 14.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $5.2 million, or 13.4%, due to increased sales in third-party hardware sales including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $8.2 million, or 10.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 24.3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $6.5 million, or 24.7%, due to ongoing installations and integration of our software solutions for our growing customer base. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $7.1 million, or 9.6%, in fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased from 52.5% to 50.4%. Products gross profit increased $0.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 18.4% to 17.6% due to a higher mix of third party hardware and software and due to certain allowances established against revenues earned in March 2020 related to products that have been or could be returned from customer locations closed in response to COVID-19 guidelines. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $4.8 million and gross profit margin decreased 195 basis points to 77.0% due to increased costs associated with hosting our customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.9% to 26.5% after we established allowances against revenues earned in March 2020 due to uncertainties related to COVID-19 conditions. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $5.2 million, or 6.0%, in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $3.6 million, or 9.6%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the reduction of cost capitalization. Certain software applications for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products joined our well-established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. We capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs during fiscal 2019, with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We did not capitalize any costs associated with product development during fiscal 2020. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $41.5 million during fiscal 2020 compared to $40.1 million in fiscal 2019. The $1.4 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&amp;D teams and infrastructure. 29 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.2 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. The change is due primarily to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to an increase collection risk of our accounts receivable as of March 31, 2020 as a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of our customers, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our annual bonus incentive plan that has declined in value due to a significant decrease in target achievements after reduced fourth quarter revenue activity with concentration in March 2020. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.3 million, or 5.4%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The change is due primarily to software investments in third-party applications to host our network and infrastructure. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.1 million or 2.8% in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles remained consistent in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Impairments. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. There were no impairments in fiscal 2019. The impairments result from specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which make it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the impacted solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We have recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $0.6 million due to a reduction in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Legal settlements, net. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters. Other (Income) Expenses nm – not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market funds and corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense, net. Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes nm – not meaningful For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 30 Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2020, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $24.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $141.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2021 through 2040. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and operating expenses including payments of lease obligations. At March 31, 2021, all $99.2 million of our cash on hand was deposited in bank accounts, of which 96% are located in the United States. We believe there is limited credit risk with respect to our cash balances. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations during our entire fiscal 2021, we cannot presently estimate its ongoing financial impact, which will be highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic. As such, due to the ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the indeterminate length of time it will affect the hospitality industry, we have maintained certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be able to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. These measures have included strict cost management actions, such as halting and altering our marketing programs, eliminating non-essential expenses including capital expenditures and reducing payroll and related costs through layoffs and furloughs as well as salary and retirement benefit reductions. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $99.2 million as of March 31, 2021, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. Cash Flow Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.4 million in fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $21.0 million adjusted for $44.0 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of approximately $5.4 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.6 million in fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $34.1 million adjusted for $46.2 million in non-cash expense including impairment charges, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $7.2 million in fiscal 2019. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $13.2 million adjusted for $22.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of approximately $2 million in net operating assets and liabilities. 31 Cash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 20 2 1 were $ 1 .4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 were $3.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 were $5.5 million. This is primarily attributed to $2.2 million in capitalized development costs of proprietary software and $3.3 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. During fiscal 2021, the $25.3 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $7.5 million for the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Cash flows used in financing activities of $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were primarily comprised of share repurchases to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases, and preferred stock dividends in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe our cash on hand, funds from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service our obligations and other commitments arising during the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies Managements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. 32 For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. 33 Allowance for e xpected c redit l osses . We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts . To help mitigate the associated credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. During fiscal 2021, we have included allowances for various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them while they deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operational priorities. Share-based compensation. We have a stock incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted shares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. The fair value for stock-settled appreciation rights with a market condition are estimated using a Lattice option pricing model which utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation . Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information about recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted and those not yet effective.","AGILYSYS, Inc.

Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 39.6%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 15.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue sales were led by the company’s add on software modules, including modules enabling social distancing and contactless capabilities. Professional services revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 33.3%, due to delays in implementation services due to customer property restrictions, property closures and lower sales from delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear.

Gross profit and gross profit margin. AI’s total gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 10.4%, in fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.4% to 65.2%. Products gross profit increased $5.4 million and gross profit margin increased from 17.6% to 49.4% driven mostly by the absence of software development cost amortization during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $6.1 million and gross profit margin increased 269 basis points to 79.7% due to increased subscription revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $3.1 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.5% to 25.5% due to the delay in professional service projects and the fixed costs of maintaining a minimum required professional services team as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations and accept implementations and installations.

"The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related notes attached thereto. All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated future capital requirements, our future development plans, our ability to obtain debt, equity or other financing, and our ability to generate cash from operations, are based on current expectations. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results or trends will necessarily continue in the future. Because the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries’ financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Business Oblong, Inc. (“Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and prior to March 6, 2020, was named Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint”). On October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (“Oblong Industries”), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms “Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company” to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger and (ii) the “combined organization” of Oblong, Inc. (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business as “Glowpoint” herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as “Oblong Industries” herein. Since the closing of the Merger on October 1, 2019, we have been focused on the integration of the businesses of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries into a combined organization. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the combined organization, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries’ product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries’ product offerings and services, and we are in the process of transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As part of the transformation of our business, we are evolving certain aspects of our model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, our technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As our core collaboration products evolve, we expect to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing. We have achieved certain revenue and cost synergies in connection with combining Oblong and Oblong Industries; we reduced the total of general and administrative, research and development and sales and marketing expenses 49% from $5,656,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $2,899,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in Oblong Industries’ technology, product development and sales and marketing. We intend to invest sales and marketing resources to expand awareness of Oblong Industries’ product offerings with the goal of increasing adoption and growing revenue. Glowpoint’s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We currently expect to continue operating the Glowpoint business as part of our combined organization, however, we plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint’s business. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2020 (“2020”) versus Year Ended December 31, 2019 (“2019”) Segment Reporting As discussed above, on October 1, 2019, the Company acquired Oblong Industries, and Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated in one segment. Effective October 1, 2019, the former businesses of Glowpoint (now Oblong, Inc.) and Oblong Industries were -21- managed separately during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020, and involved different products and services. Accordingly, the Company currently operates in two segments: (1) the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network and (2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies. Because the closing of the acquisition of Oblong Industries occurred on October 1, 2019, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Report only reflect Oblong Industries’ financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Certain information concerning the Company’s segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is presented in the following table (in thousands): -22- Unallocated operating expenses include costs, after the October 1, 2019 acquisition date, that are not specific to a particular segment but are general to the group; included are expenses incurred for administrative and accounting staff, general liability and other insurance, professional fees and other similar corporate expenses. Interest and other (income) expense, net, is also not allocated to the operating segments. As shown in the table below, the combined organization’s total revenue for calendar year 2019 on a pro forma basis (as if the acquisition of Oblong Industries had occurred on January 1, 2019), was $25.6 million. Revenue. Total revenue increased $2,506,000 (or 20%) in 2020 to $15,333,000 from $12,827,000 in 2019. The following table summarizes the changes in components of our revenue, and the significant changes in revenue are discussed in more detail below. -23- Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) • Revenue for managed services for video collaboration services decreased $3,153,000 (or 57%) to $2,413,000 in 2020, from $5,566,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower revenue from existing customers (either from reductions in price or level of services) and loss of customers to competition. • Revenue for network services decreased $249,000 (or 6%) to $3,611,000 in 2020 from $3,860,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in the network services business. • Revenue for professional and other services decreased $31,000 (or 13%) to $203,000 in 2020 from $234,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower resale of video equipment. Oblong Industries • For Oblong Industries, the increase in revenue in each of the different components is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 includes a full year of revenue, compared to revenue for 2019, which only included three months. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 decreased compared to pro forma 2019, shown above, primarily as a result of delayed fulfillment and order placements and cancellation of professional services, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. • Revenue for visual collaboration product offerings increased $4,693,000 (or 215%) to $6,873,000 in 2020 from $2,180,000 in 2019. • Revenue for professional services increased $324,000 (or 46%) to $1,033,000 in 2020 from $709,000 in 2019. Oblong Industries’ professional service revenue was generated from a specialized group of personnel that delivered innovative architectural scale spatial computing solutions for customers implementing Executive Briefing Centers, Command Centers, Television studios and Virtual Wargaming environments. A former customer terminated our professional services effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. Our professional services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate revenue from professional services in 2021 and in the future. • Revenue for licensing increased $922,000 (or 332%) to $1,200,000 in 2020 from $278,000 in 2019. A former customer terminated the licensing of our technology effective December, 31 2020. Our licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to this customer. We do not expect to generate material revenue from licensing in 2021. -24- Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) . Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes all internal and external costs related to the delivery of revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the cost for taxes which have been billed to customers. Cost of revenue decreased to $7,280,000 in 2020 from $7,427,000 in 2019. The $147,000 decrease in cost of revenue from 2019 to 2020 is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the decrease in Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) revenue during the same period, partially offset by the increased costs related to the increase in revenue for Oblong Industries from 2019 to 2020. The Company’s total gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 53% in 2020 as compared to 42% in 2019. For Oblong, gross profit, as a percentage of Oblong revenue, improved to 39% for 2020 from 35% for 2019. This improvement was due to reduced personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. For Oblong Industries, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue was 62% for of 2020 as compared to 63% for 2019. Research and Development . Research and development expenses include internal and external costs related to developing features and enhancements to our existing services. Research and development expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,711,000 and $2,023,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of research and development expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019. Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,392,000 and $1,936,000, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to a full year of sales and marketing expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020, as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019. General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses include direct corporate expenses related to costs of personnel in the various corporate support categories, including executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and information technology. General and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $6,724,000 and $5,377,000, respectively. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase related to a full year of general and administrative expenses for Oblong Industries in 2020 as compared to inclusion of only the fourth quarter for 2019. Impairment Charges . Impairment charges in 2020 and 2019 were $1,150,000 and $2,317,000, respectively. The impairment charges for 2020 are primarily attributable to $541,000 on Oblong’s goodwill, $465,000 on right-of-use assets related to Oblong Industries operating leases, and $144,000 on assets no longer used in the business. For 2019, the impairment charges are primarily attributable to $2,254,000 on goodwill and $63,000 on capitalized software no longer in service. Future declines of our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record impairment charges in the future related to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2020 and 2019 were $3,140,000 and $1,321,000, respectively. This increase of $1,819,000 is mainly attributable to $2,878,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in 2020 related to assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Oblong Industries, compared to $754,000 of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $305,000 in depreciation and amortization expense for Oblong as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2020. Loss from Operations. Loss from operations increased to $10,064,000 in 2020 from $7,574,000 in 2019. The increase in the Company’s loss from operations is mainly attributable to an increase of $5,143,000 in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase of $2,653,000 in gross profit, as discussed further above. Interest and Other (Income) Expense, Net . Interest and other (income) expense in 2020 was income of $2,746,000, comprised of (i) a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,117,000 related to the satisfaction of the SVB loan, partially offset by (ii) $352,000 of interest expense on the Company’s debt obligations. Interest and other expense, net in 2019 was $187,000, comprised of (i) $97,000 of interest expense on the Company’s debt obligations with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) during the fourth quarter of 2019, and (ii) $90,000 of amortization of debt discount costs related to the SVB Loan Agreement. -25- Income Tax Expense. We did not record any income tax expense in 2020 and 2019 (see Note 17 - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements). Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5,277,000 (including restricted cash of $219,000) and $4,602,000 of cash, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $7,421,000 and $7,761,000, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was $6,566,000 and $3,253,000, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was $31,000 and primarily related to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $2,149,000, and primarily related to cash acquired in the merger. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $7,272,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $7,371,000 from two private placements of common stock and $2,417,000 of proceeds from the PPP Loan, partially offset by the satisfaction payment of $2,500,000 on the SVB Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $3,699,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3,750,000 from a private placement of Series E Preferred Stock, partially offset by $51,000 used to purchase treasury stock. SVB Loan Agreement On October 1, 2019, in connection with the Acquisition of Oblong Industries, the Company and Oblong Industries, as borrowers, and Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), as lender, executed an amendment to the SVB Loan Agreement. On October 24, 2019, GP Communications joined the SVB Loan Agreement as an additional co-borrower. The SVB Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility of approximately $5,247,000, (the “SVB Loan”), all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2019. On June 26, 2020, the Company and SVB entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the SVB Loan Agreement. Under the Amendment, the Bank agreed to extend the interest-only payment period under the SVB Loan Agreement through September 30, 2020, after which equal monthly principal payments of $291,500 were payable over an eighteen month period from October 1, 2020 through March 1, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”) to fully repay the loan. The SVB Loan originally accrued interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Agreement) plus 200 basis points (for a total of 6.75% as of December 31, 2019). In connection with the Amendment, the interest rate under the SVB Loan was increased to the Prime Rate plus 425 basis points (for a total of 7.50% as of September 30, 2020). In connection with its execution of the amended SVB Loan Agreement on October 1, 2019, the Company (i) agreed to pay SVB a fee of $100,000 on April 1, 2020 (the “Deferral Fee”) and (ii) issued a warrant to SVB that entitles SVB to purchase 72,394 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the “SVB Warrant”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the due date for the Deferral Fee was changed to the earlier of (i) the maturity of the loan, (ii) the repayment in full of all principal and interest owing under the Loan Agreement, and (iii) occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement. The SVB Warrant has a ten (10) year term. The fair value of the SVB Warrant was recorded to additional paid-in capital and was determined to be $72,000 using the Black-Scholes model. The total obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement were $5,509,000, comprised of $5,247,000 for the SVB Loan, the Deferral Fee and the Maturity Fee of $262,000 that was assumed on October 1, 2019 as part of the Acquisition. The Deferral Fee, the fair value of the SVB Warrant, and $20 of debt issuance costs totaled $192 and was recorded as a discount to the debt. The remaining unamortized debt discount as of December 31, 2019 was $130,000. This debt discount was being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company amortized $81,000 of the debt discount, which is recorded in “Interest and other expense, Net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $49 of the discount was forgiven in the Satisfaction Agreement discussed below. On October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Satisfaction Agreement”) with SVB as lender, pursuant to which SVB agreed to accept a one-time cash payment of $2,500,000 (the “Satisfaction Payment”) in satisfaction of the Company’s outstanding payment obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions. SVB also agreed to release the security interests and other liens previously granted to or held by SVB as security for the Company’s obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement. The Company made the Satisfaction Payment on October 22, 2020. The remaining balance of $3,062,000, net of discount, as well as $55,000 of accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as a “Gain on Extinguishment of Debt” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no outstanding obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement. -26- Future Capital Requirements and Going Concern As of December 31, 2020, we had $5,277,000 of cash and restricted cash. As of December 31, 2020 and the filing of this Report, we had $2,417,000 of total obligations under the PPP Loan. The Company estimates that approximately $2,266,000 of the PPP Loan will be forgiven. However, this estimate is subject to change and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive any forgiveness for any fixed amount of any PPP Loan principal received by the Company. Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization’s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, and the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan. While our acquisition of Oblong Industries provides additional revenues to the Company, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong Industries’ product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to invest in Oblong Industries’ product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company’s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization’s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding certain additional factors that could impact the Company’s liquidity in the future. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accoutning Principles (“GAAP”). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) Revenue billed in advance for video collaboration services is deferred until the revenue has been earned, which is when the related services have been performed. Other service revenue, including amounts passed through based on surcharges from our telecom carriers, related to the network services and collaboration services are recognized as service is provided. As the non-refundable, upfront installation and activation fees charged to our customers do not meet the criteria as a separate unit of accounting, they are deferred and recognized over the 12 to 24-month period estimated life of the customer relationship. Revenue related to professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Oblong Industries The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606 “ Revenue from Contracts with Customers .” Topic 606 requires entities to recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The costs associated with obtaining a customer contract under Topic 606 are deferred on our consolidated balance sheet and amortized over the expected life of the customer. Oblong Industries’ core platform is g-speak™, and Mezzanine™ is its flagship product built on this platform. Mezzanine™ offers advanced collaboration for conference room technology, which amplifies sales presentations, enhances group collaboration, and makes work sessions more productive. The Company offers g-speak development licenses to larger enterprise customers. The Company’s products are systems that consist of hardware and software that function together to -27- deliver the system’s essential functionality. The Company sells the systems as a complete package and does not sell the hardware and software separately. The Company also sells maintenance and support contracts and license agreements. The Company has determined that its systems and service contracts have value to a customer on a standalone basis; therefore, revenue from each item should be recognized separately. The Company establishes the relative selling price of each deliverable based on estimated selling price. The Company recognizes product revenue from its systems upon shipment, installation revenue upon completed installation and revenue from maintenance contracts and license agreements ratably over the applicable periods, ranging from 12 to 36 months. Professional service contracts are billed based on time and materials at the contract rate as the services are rendered. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 totaled $1,723,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 totaled $1,901,000 as certain performance obligations were not satisfied as of this date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $999,000 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets used in operations, primarily fixed assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are compared to the carrying amounts of those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets exceed the undiscounted cash flows, then the related assets will be written down to fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded asset impairment charges on property and equipment of $144,000 and $63,000, respectively, which pertained primarily to assets no longer used in the business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company disposed of fixed assets of $3,438,000, and the corresponding accumulated depreciation of $3,287,000, which resulted in a loss on disposal of $151,000. There were no impairments to purchased intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $465,000 on two right-of-use assets. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion. There were no impairments to right-of-use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASC Topic 350”). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was $7,367,000 and $7,908,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all of the goodwill was recorded in connection with the October 1, 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on September 30 of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. Prior to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019, the Company operated as a single reporting unit and used its market capitalization to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as of each test date. In order to determine the market capitalization, the Company used the trailing 20-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of its stock as of each period end. For the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) reporting unit, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $541,000 and $2,254,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value on the applicable test dates. These charges are recognized as “Impairment Charges” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the Oblong segment no longer has any goodwill included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020. In the event we experience future declines in our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price, this may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges on goodwill in the future. Intangible Assets . Intangible assets total $10,140,000 and $12,572,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company assesses the impairment of purchased intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments, related primarily to the future profitability and/or future value of the assets. Changes in the Company’s strategic plan and/or other-than-temporary changes in market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances has occurred that could have a significant adverse effect on the -28- fair value of long-lived assets. The Company performed evaluations of intangible assets as of each quarter end during 2019 and 2020 and determined that no impairment charges were required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which range from five to twelve years in accordance with ASC Topic 350 “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” Inflation Management does not believe inflation had a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See the sections titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently adopted accounting pronouncements” and “Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted” in Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.","Since the closing of the Merger on October 1, 2019, the company have been focused on the integration of the businesses of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries into a combined organization. The company believes there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries’ product offerings and services, and it is in the process of transforming its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its customers. As part of the transformation of its business, the company is evolving certain aspects of its model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, the company’s technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As the company’s core collaboration products evolve, it expects to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing.

The company has achieved certain revenue and cost synergies in connection with combining Oblong and Oblong Industries; the company reduced the total of general and administrative, research and development and sales and marketing expenses 49% from $5,656,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $2,899,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company believes that additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in Oblong Industries’ technology, product development and sales and marketing. The company intends to invest sales and marketing resources to expand awareness of Oblong Industries’ product offerings with the goal of increasing adoption and growing revenue.

Glowpoint’s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which the company expects to continue. the company currently expects to continue operating the Glowpoint business as part of its combined organization, however, the company plans to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint’s business.

The company currently operates in two segments: (1) the Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) business which mainly consists of managed services for video collaboration and network and (2) the Oblong Industries business which consists of products and services for visual collaboration technologies.

Total revenue increased $2,506,000 (or 20%) in 2020 to $15,333,000 from $12,827,000 in 2019. 

•Revenue for managed services for video collaboration services decreased $3,153,000 (or 57%) to $2,413,000 in 2020, from $5,566,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower revenue from existing customers (either from reductions in price or level of services) and loss of customers to competition.

•Revenue for network services decreased $249,000 (or 6%) to $3,611,000 in 2020 from $3,860,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to net attrition of customers and lower demand for its services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in the network services business.

•Revenue for professional and other services decreased $31,000 (or 13%) to $203,000 in 2020 from $234,000 in 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower resale of video equipment.

•For Oblong Industries, the increase in revenue in each of the different components is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Oblong Industries on October 1, 2019. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 includes a full year of revenue, compared to revenue for 2019, which only included three months. Oblong Industries revenue for 2020 decreased compared to pro forma 2019, shown above, primarily as a result of delayed fulfillment and order placements and cancellation of professional services, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Cost of revenue decreased to $7,280,000 in 2020 from $7,427,000 in 2019. The $147,000 decrease in cost of revenue from 2019 to 2020 is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the decrease in Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) revenue during the same period, partially offset by the increased costs related to the increase in revenue for Oblong Industries from 2019 to 2020. The Company’s total gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 53% in 2020 as compared to 42% in 2019. For Oblong, gross profit, as a percentage of Oblong revenue, improved to 39% for 2020 from 35% for 2019. This improvement was due to reduced personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. For Oblong Industries, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue was 62% for of 2020 as compared to 63% for 2019.

Interest and other (income) expense in 2020 was income of $2,746,000, comprised of (i) a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,117,000 related to the satisfaction of the SVB loan, partially offset by (ii) $352,000 of interest expense on the Company’s debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had $5,277,000 (including restricted cash of $219,000) and $4,602,000 of cash, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company incurred net losses of $7,421,000 and $7,761,000, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was $6,566,000 and $3,253,000, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was $31,000 and primarily related to purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $2,149,000, and primarily related to cash acquired in the merger.

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $7,272,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $7,371,000 from two private placements of common stock and $2,417,000 of proceeds from the PPP Loan, partially offset by the satisfaction payment of $2,500,000 on the SVB Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2019 was $3,699,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3,750,000 from a private placement of Series E Preferred Stock, partially offset by $51,000 used to purchase treasury stock.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2021 include: We are a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers around the world. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global business environment and on our clients, but our priority has been and continues to be the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients. We have continued to provide HCM services, including the processing of payroll and tax obligations, to our clients during this time. ADP's efforts have also been focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally. In addition, we released a Return to Workplace solution that assists our clients in bringing their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline the entire process. 26 During the fiscal year, we continued to advance our market-leading solutions and achieved some new milestones. Earlier this year, our next-gen payroll solution earned ADP its 6th consecutive “Top HR Product Award” at the annual HR Technology Conference. This solution features a highly scalable, policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency. In February, we announced the launch of Roll, a new mobile-first payroll and tax filing product aimed at small businesses, which combines an AI-driven chat-based interface with the power and scale of our payroll and tax filing expertise. We continued to add to our robust DataCloud platform by introducing the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Dashboard which can help businesses analyze their diversity landscape through a simple Q&amp;A format and user interface that allows them to better set, track and expand their DEI goals. For our RUN platform, which is a leading solution in the market with approximately 750,000 clients, we began to roll out a new user experience and launched TimeKeeping Plus, an entirely new, native workforce management solution. This year, we reached 100,000 clients across our workforce management solutions for the first time, as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for our clients while they navigate the new norm of increasingly flexible schedules and work arrangements. Our suite of HRO solutions also continued to deliver steady growth this year, despite the dynamic economic environment. Within PEO, the average worksite employee count grew 12% in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of 2%. We also have over 2 million worksite employees on our other HRO solutions within our Employer Services segment, as clients look for ways to outsource parts of the HR function to a best-in-class provider like ADP. We continue to drive innovation by anticipating our clients' evolving needs and always designing for people as the world of work changes. We lead the HCM industry by driving growth through our strategic, cloud-based HCM solutions and developing innovations like our next gen platforms. We further enable these solutions by supplementing them with organic, differentiated investments such as the ADP Datacloud and ADP Marketplace, and through our compliance expertise. For fiscal 2021, we drove solid revenue growth of 3% for the year, continued to invest for sustainable growth despite market conditions, and managed any non-essential spend prudently. Employer Services New Business Bookings was up 23% for fiscal 2021. In addition, the Employer Services client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2021 improved 170 basis points to 92.2% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2020. The PEO average number of Worksite Employees increased 2% for fiscal 2021. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, turned positive in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of negative 3% for fiscal 2021. We have a strong business model, a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments, our longer term strategy, and our commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2021 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients. 27 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Total Revenues For the year ended June 30, respectively: Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased due to strong retention, new business started from New Business Bookings, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs and one percentage point of favorability from foreign currency. This increase is partially offset by a one percentage point of pressure from our interest earned on funds held for clients discussed below . Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discus sion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. Total revenues in fiscal 2021 include interest on funds held for clients of $422.4 million , as compared to $545.2 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in our average interest rate earned to 1.5% in fiscal 2021, as compared to 2.1% in fiscal 2020. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balances of 5.2% to $27.4 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. 28 Total Expenses For the year ended June 30, 2021, operating expenses increased due to the increase in our PEO Services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs to $3,092.0 million from $2,907.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the impact of foreign currency, and an increase in incentive compensation costs due to decreases in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by reduced costs as a result of our broad-based transformation initiatives and excess capacity headcount actions in the prior year, a change of $52.5 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity compared to prior year, reduced travel expenses and decreased pension costs as a result of U.S. pension service costs that were eliminated with the July 1, 2020 cessation of U.S. participants accruing any future service benefits (“U.S. pension freeze”). Systems development and programming costs increased fo r fiscal 2021 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by capitalization of costs related to our strategic projects, including our next gen platforms. Depreciation and amortization expe nse increased relat ed to the amortization of our acquisitions of intangibles and internally developed software. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2021 due to an increase in incentive compensation costs, investments in our sales organization, and the impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a decrease in charges related to transformation initiatives, reduced costs as a result of our broad-based transformation initiatives and excess capacity headcount actions in the prior year for non-sales associates, capitalization of costs to obtain a contract under ASC 606, reduced travel expenses, legal settlements, and a decrease in bad debt expense. Interest expense decreased for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings to 0.1% for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 1.6% for the year ended June 30, 2020. This was coupled with a decrease in average daily borrowings under our commercial paper program to $1.6 billion for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $2.7 billion for the year ended June 30, 2020. Other (Income)/Expense, net 29 Other (income)/expense, net, decreased $51.7 million in fiscal 2021 , as compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of a decrease in interest income on corporate funds due to lower interest rates earned and the change in non-service components of pension income, net, and the items described below. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on non-service components of pension income, net. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges of $19.9 million which is comprised of a write down of $10.5 million related to internally developed software which was determined to have no future use, impairment charges of $9.4 million related to operating right-of-use assets and certain related fixed assets associated with vacating certain leased locations early, and recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale. In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $29.9 million, which is comprised of $25.3 million as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and vacating certain leased locations early and recorded total impairment charges of $4.6 million related to operating right-of-use assets and certain related fixed assets associated with the vacated locations. Earnings Before Income Taxes For the year ended June 30, respectively: Earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2021 due to the increases in revenues partially offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased in fiscal 2021 as a result of operational efficiencies, coupled with a decrease in charges related to transformation initiatives, legal settlements, reduced costs as a result of our broad-based transformation initiatives and excess capacity headcount actions in the prior year, a change of $52.5 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity compared to prior year, decreased selling expense, and decreased interest expense. These were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs, a decrease in interest earned on funds held for clients, and incremental pressure from growth in our zero-margin benefits pass-throughs. 30 Adjusted Earnings before certain Interest and Taxes (""Adjusted EBIT"") For the year ended June 30, respectively: Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin exclude certain interest amount s, legal settlements, gain on sale of assets, net charges related to our broad-based transformation initiatives and the impact of the net severance charges as applicable in the respective periods. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 22.7% and 22.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to combined benefits from a valuation allowance release related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and a foreign tax law change during fiscal 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation, partially offset by favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities during fiscal 2021. Refer t o Note 11, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Adjusted Provision for Income Taxe s The adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 22.7% and 22.6%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above. 31 Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share For the year ended June 30, respectively: For fiscal 2021, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the changes in components described above. For fiscal 2021, diluted EPS increased as a result of the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 8.2 million shares during fiscal 2021 and 6.2 million shares during fiscal 2020, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share For the year ended June 30, respectively: For fiscal 2021, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the changes in components described above. 32 ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS n/m - not meaningful Employer Services Revenues Revenues increased in fiscal 2021 due to strong retention, business started from New Business Bookings and one percentage point of favorability from foreign currency. Employer Services client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2021 improved 170 basis points to 92.2% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2020. Increases in revenues were partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on funds held for clients. Earnings before Income Taxes Employer Services’ earnings before income taxes was flat in fiscal 2021 due to increased revenues discussed above offset by increases in expenses. The increases in expenses were due to an increase in incentive compensation costs, investments in our sales organization, an increase in amortization expense, and the impact of foreign currency. The increases in expenses were offset by reduced costs as a result of our broad-based transformation initiatives and excess capacity headcount actions for non-sales associates, reduced travel expenses, and a decrease in bad debt expense. 33 For the year ended June 30, respectively: Employer Services' overall margin decreased for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in incentive compensation costs, a decrease in interest earned on funds held for clients, and an increase in amortization expense. This decrease was partially offset by reduced costs as a result of our broad-based transformation initiatives and excess capacity headcount actions in the prior year, and a decrease in bad debt expense. Revenues PEO Services' revenues increased 7% and PEO Services' revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-through costs increased 8% in fiscal 2021. PEO Services' revenues increased due to a 2% increase in the average number of Worksite Employees in fiscal 2021 driven by an increase in the number of new PEO Services clients, partially offset by a modest decline in pays per control. Earnings before Income Taxes PEO Services’ earnings before income taxes increased 18% in fiscal 2021 due to increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in expenses. The increases in expenses were due to the increase in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs of $184.3 million described above, partially offset by a change of $52.5 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity compared to the prior year, and a decrease in selling expenses. 34 For the year ended June 30, respectively: PEO Services' overall margin increased for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in revenues as discussed above, a change in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity compared to the prior year, and a decrease in selling expenses. ADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. During fiscal 2021, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $240 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2021 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $32 million in fiscal 2021 and a pre-tax loss of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $260 million in July 2021 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2022 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2021 reinsurance policy. Other The primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, legal settlements, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest expense. 35 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods: We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies. 36 (a) We include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.” (b) In fiscal 2021, transformation initiatives include impairment charges as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and lease asset impairment charges, offset by gain on sale of assets and net reversals of charges related to other transformation initiatives, including severance. Unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. 37 (c) Represents net severance cost related to excess capacity. Unlike certain other severance charges in prior periods that are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide initiatives to address excess capacity across our business and functions, including charges in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (d) Represents legal settlements including an insurance recovery in fiscal 2021. (e) The income tax provision/(benefit) was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended June 30, 2021. (f) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes. The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalent s were $2.6 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds. For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our $9.7 billion of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2021 and we have sufficient liquidity as noted above; how ever, given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our financial condition and liquidity. For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks, including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper. 38 Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flow s Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are summarized as follows: Net cash flows provided by operating activities increase d due to a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $6,771.2 million. Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $11,549.4 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, and proceeds fro m debt issuances. These were partially offset by payments of debt, more cash returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and settlement of cash flow hedges in fiscal 2021. We purchased approximately 8.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $170.04 during fis cal 2021, as compared to purchases of 6.2 million shares at an average price per share of $160.61 during fiscal 2020. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. Capital Resources and Client Fund Obligations We have $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, and 2030. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our notes. Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securiti es. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value . Our c ommercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows: Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by 39 government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were $23.5 million and $13.6 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows: We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $3.75 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2022 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility maturing in June 2024 and June 2026, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We ha d no borrowings thr ough June 30, 2021 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through June 30, 2021. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were $178.3 million, as compared to $168.3 million for fiscal 2020. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $200 million and $225 million. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at June 30, 2021: (1) These amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt. 40 (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations are comprised of a $260 million reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal 2022 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets. (4) Based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to $14.8 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. For $85.1 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid. (5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. These amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $10.0 million in fiscal 2022. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2021, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2022, total $34,403.8 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $34,905.8 million of cas h and cash e quivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2021. Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a p remium of $260 million in Ju ly 2021 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2022 policy year. At June 30, 2021, ADP Indemnity had total assets of $564.2 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $487.4 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. ADP Indemnity paid claims of $3.3 million and $4.4 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to the “Analysis of Reportable Segments - PEO Services” above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents. We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s 41 obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, including the COVID-19 pandemic, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 10 years, and for AA-rated and AAA-rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf. Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rat e changes. The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 2.1% for fiscal 2020 to 1.5% for fiscal 2021. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $22 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2022. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2022. 42 We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. Approxi mately 72% of our a vailable-for-sale securities held a AAA-rating or AA-rating at June 30, 2021. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities. We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. In addition, as the duration and severity of COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, certain of our estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve, our estimates may change materially in future periods. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are Revenue Recognition (including Deferred Costs), Goodwill and Income Taxes. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our policies for Revenue Recognition (including Deferred Costs), Goodwill and Income Taxes. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2021 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences. As such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins. Based upon the quantitative assessment, the Company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired. As the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations, we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.","AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. (“ADPI”)

Automatic Data Processing is a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers around the world. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global business environment and on the company’s clients, but ADPI continued to provide HCM services. ADPI's efforts have also been focused on providing information and tools to help its clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally. In addition, ADPI released a Return to Workplace solution that assists its clients in bringing their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline the entire process. This year, ADPI reached 100,000 clients across its workforce management solutions for the first time, as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for its clients.

For fiscal 2021, ADPI drove revenue growth of 3% for the year, continued to invest for sustainable growth despite market conditions, and managed any non-essential spend prudently. Employer Services New Business Bookings was up 23% for fiscal 2021. ADPI’s pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADPI clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, turned positive in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of negative 3% for fiscal 2021.

The company has a strong business model, a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity, and offers a suite of products that provide critical support to its clients’ HCM functions. ADPI generates sufficient free cash flow to satisfy its cash dividend and its modest debt obligations, which enables the company to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in reinvestments, its longer term strategy, and its commitments to shareholder friendly actions. ADPI is committed to building upon the past successes by investing in its business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way it operates. ADPI’s financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2021 and the company remains well positioned to support its associates and its clients.

Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased due to strong retention, new business started from New Business Bookings, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs and one percentage point of favorability from foreign currency. This increase is partially offset by a one percentage point of pressure from its interest earned on funds held for clients.

For the year ended June 30, 2021, operating expenses increased due to the increase in ADPI’s Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs to $3,092.0 million from $2,907.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively

Interest expense decreased for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings to 0.1% for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 1.6% for the year ended June 30, 2020. This was coupled with a decrease in average daily borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program to $1.6 billion for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $2.7 billion for the year ended June 30, 2020.

Earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2021 due to the increases in revenues partially offset by the increases in operating expenses.

As of June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

For corporate liquidity, ADPI expects existing cash, cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and the company’s ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet ADPI’s operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.

For client funds liquidity, ADPI has the ability to borrow through its financing arrangements under the U.S. short-term commercial paper program and its U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with ADPI’s $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and its ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020.

Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $6,771.2 million.

Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $11,549.4 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from ADP’s clients and payments to its clients' employees and other payees, and proceeds from debt issuances. These were partially offset by payments of debt, more cash returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and settlement of cash flow hedges in fiscal 2021.

The company has $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, and 2030.

ADPI’s U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. The company’s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch.

The company varies the maturities of its committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. ADPI has a $3.75 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2022 with a one year term-out option. In addition, ADPI has a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility maturing in June 2024 and June 2026, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The company had no borrowings through June 30, 2021 under the credit facilities.

ADPI’s investment portfolio contains AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through June 30, 2021. In addition, ADPI owns U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were $178.3 million, as compared to $168.3 million for fiscal 2020. The company expects capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $200 million and $225 million.

"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, (the ""MD&amp;A""), describes the principal factors, based on management’s assessment, which have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&amp;A generally includes a discussion of results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources related to year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, as well as fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, and 2019. The following discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the corresponding notes, and included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The information presented in this section includes forward-looking statements, which are described in detail in the section titled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.” The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected, or implied in the forward-looking statements. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions associated with these statements. Overview Cerence builds AI powered virtual assistants for the mobility/transportation market. Our primary target is the automobile market, but our solutions can apply to all forms of transportation including but not limited to two-wheel vehicles, planes, tractors, cruise ships and elevators. Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between automobiles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We possess one of the world’s most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants. Our customers include all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between automobile brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone. Our principal offering is our software platform, which our customers use to build virtual assistants that can communicate, find information and take action across an expanding variety of categories. Our software platform has a hybrid architecture combining edge software components with cloud-connected components. Edge software components are installed on a vehicle’s head unit and can operate without access to external networks and information. Cloud-connected components are comprised of certain speech and natural language understanding related technologies, AI-enabled personalization and context-based response frameworks, and content integration platform. We generate revenue primarily by selling software licenses and cloud-connected services. Our edge software components are typically sold under a traditional per unit perpetual software license model, in which a per unit fee is charged for each software instance installed on an automotive head unit. We typically license cloud-connected software components in the form of a service to the vehicle end user, which is paid for in advance. In addition, we generate professional services revenue from our work with our customers during the design, development and deployment phases of the vehicle model lifecycle and through maintenance and enhancement projects. We have existing relationships with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers, and while our customer contracts vary, they generally represent multi-year engagements, giving us visibility into future revenue. Impact of COVID-19 on our Business As the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continues to develop, we are closely monitoring the global situation. We are unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our operations, liquidity and financial results, and, depending on the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, such impact may be material. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends. For further discussion of the business risks associated with COVID-19, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, within this Form 10-K report. Business Trends We experienced total revenue growth of 17.0% and 9.1%, during fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by our connected and professional services revenues due to increased market penetration of our connected and professional services solutions. License revenues increased during fiscal 2021 due to higher volume of licensing royalties as the global auto industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and OEMs increased production. 34 During fiscal year 202 1 , t otal cost of revenues decreased by 6.3% , primarily driven by our cost savings initiatives . T otal operating expenses grew by 12.4% during fiscal year 20 2 1 , primarily driven by innovation initiatives in order to increase our competitive position in the market. Our R&amp;D expenses increased 26.1% , as our R&amp;D and engineering workforces refocused on developing new products and advancing our core technologies. Restructuring and other costs, net decreased $11.4 million as expenditures to establish the Cerence business as a standalone public company were not repeated in fiscal 2021. W e anticipate that our R&amp;D expenses will continue to represent a majority of our operating expenses as we focus on innovation and serving our customers. Basis of Presentation Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the fiscal years presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, as well as those of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we identified and corrected immaterial errors related to previously issued consolidated financial statements. In order to present the impact of the resulting adjustments, previously issued financial statements have been revised. See Note 19 – Impact on Previously Issued Financial Statements for Immaterial Adjustments in the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, within this Form 10-K for additional details. Accordingly, the tables presented in the MD&amp;A reflect the impact of those revisions. The errors had no impact on the discussions related to year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Fiscal year 2019 Standalone financial statements had not been historically prepared for the Cerence business. The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared from Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance” or “Parent”)’s historical accounting records and are presented on a “carve out” basis to include the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows applicable to the Cerence business. As a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all the various business units comprising the Cerence business, Nuance’s investment in the Cerence business was shown in lieu of stockholders’ equity in the combined financial statements. The Combined Statement of Operations included all revenues and costs directly attributable to Cerence as well as an allocation of expenses related to functions and services performed by centralized Parent organizations. These corporate expenses have been allocated to the Cerence business based on direct usage or benefit, where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount, number of transactions or other measures as determined appropriate. The Combined Statement of Cash Flows presented these corporate expenses that are cash in nature as cash flows from operating activities, as this was the nature of these costs at the Parent. Non-cash expenses allocated from the Parent included corporate depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation included as add-back adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operations. The combined financial statements included the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Nuance corporate level or by shared entities, but which are specifically identifiable or allocable to the Cerence business. These shared assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Cerence business on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, or allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount or other systematic measures that reflect utilization of the services provided to or benefits received by Cerence. The Parent used a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations. Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency hedges or debt and related interest expense had been allocated to the Cerence business in the combined financial statements. The Parent’s short and long-term debt had not been pushed down to the Cerence business’s combined financial statements because the Cerence business was not the legal obligor of the debt and the Parent’s borrowings were not directly attributable to the Cerence business. Transactions between the Parent and the Cerence business are considered to be effectively settled in the combined financial statements at the time the transaction was recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions was reflected in the Combined Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity and in the Combined Balance Sheet as net parent investment. All of the allocations and estimates in the combined financial statements are based on assumptions which management believed are reasonable. However, the combined financial statements included herein may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows if the Cerence business had been a separate, standalone entity during the period presented. 35 Key Metrics In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus on revenue, operating margins, and cash flow from operations. For the fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020: For fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019: Operating Results The following table shows the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and the Combined Statement of Operations for the fiscal year 2019 (dollars in thousands): 36 Our revenue consists primarily of license revenue, connected services revenue and revenue from professional services.

Connected services revenue represents the subscription fee that provides access to our connected services components, including the customization and construction of our connected services solutions. Cost of connected service revenue primarily consists of labor costs of software delivery services, infrastructure, and communications fees that support our connected services solutions. Professional services revenue is primarily comprised of porting, integrating, and customizing our embedded solutions, with costs primarily consisting of compensation for services personnel, contractors and overhead. Our operating expenses include R&amp;D, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. R&amp;D expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, and overhead relating to research and engineering staff.

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for administration, finance, human resources, general management, fees for external professional advisers including accountants and attorneys, and provisions for credit losses. Amortization of acquired patents and core technology are included within cost of revenues whereas the amortization of other intangible assets, such as acquired customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, are included within operating expenses. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Restructuring and other costs, net include restructuring expenses as well as other charges that are unusual in nature, are the result of unplanned events, and arise outside the ordinary course of our business. Acquisition-related costs include transition and integration costs, professional service fees, and fair value adjustments related to business and asset acquisitions, including potential acquisitions.

Operating Expenses The tables below show each component of operating expense. Other income (expense), net and provision for income taxes are non-operating expenses and presented in a similar format (dollars in thousands). 40 R&amp;D Expenses Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Historically, R&amp;D expenses are our largest operating expense as we continue to build on our existing software platforms and develop new technologies. R&amp;D expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $112.1 million, an increase of $23.2 million, or 26.1%, from $88.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in R&amp;D expenses was primarily attributable to a $11.5 million increase in salary-related expenditures driven by headcount growth, as well as a $5.4 million increase in third-party contractor costs, a $2.6 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $6.5 million reduction in labor allocated to support our customer projects partially offset by a $5.1 million increase of capitalized cost associated with internally developed software. As a percentage of total operating expenses, R&amp;D expenses increased by 5.4 percentage points from 44.3% for fiscal year 2020 to 49.7% for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 R&amp;D expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $88.9 million, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 4.5%, from $93.1 million for fiscal year 2019. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted a portion of our R&amp;D workforce to support our professional service teams, which led to a decline in R&amp;D expenses as a result of internal labor cost allocations. R&amp;D costs also declined due to capitalization of costs associated with internally developed software of $2.7 million and reduction of stock-based compensation of $2.0 million. The decline in R&amp;D expenses were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in contractor costs. As a percentage of total operating expenses, R&amp;D expenses decreased by 3.9 percentage points from 48.2% for fiscal year 2019 to 44.3% for fiscal year 2020. Sales &amp; Marketing Expenses Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $38.7 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 15.8%, from $33.4 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to $3.1 million increase in salary related expenses, $3.0 million increase related to stock-based compensation, and $0.4 million related to commission expenses. The increase was partly offset by a reduction of $0.9 million in travel-related expenditures as a result of COVID-19 and $0.7 million in marketing spending. As a percentage of total operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses increased by 0.6 percentage points from 16.6% for fiscal year 2020 to 17.2% for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $33.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 7.9%, from $36.3 million for fiscal year 2019. Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due lower compensation related expenses, including $1.9 million attributed to salary-related expenses and $2.7 million related to commission expenses. We also experienced a reduction of $1.1 million in travel-related expenditures as a result of COVID-19. The decrease was partly offset by stock-based compensation expenses, which increased $3.4 million. As a percentage of total operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 2.2 percentage points from 18.8% for fiscal year 2019 to 16.6% for fiscal year 2020. General &amp; Administrative Expenses 41 Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 General and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $57.0 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 15.4%, from $49.4 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to $7.5 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $2.1 million increase in depreciation, a $1.8 million increase in professional service fees and a $1.4 million increase in salary-related expenses. The increases were partly offset by a $1.2 million decrease in third-party contractor costs, a $1.1 million decreases in bad debt expenses and $0.6 million decrease in travel-related expenditures as a result of COVID-19. As a percentage of total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.7 percentage points from 24.6% for fiscal year 2020 to 25.3% for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 General and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $49.4 million, an increase of $23.5 million, or 90.5%, from $25.9 million for fiscal year 2019. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to our operation as a standalone public company during fiscal year 2020. We incurred higher compensation related expenses, including $8.5 million attributed to salary-related expenses and $12.5 attributed to stock-based compensation expenses. In addition, professional service expenses increased $3.0 million. As a percentage of total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses increased by 11.2 percentage points from 13.4% for fiscal year 2019 to 24.6% for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of Intangible Assets Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Intangible asset amortization for fiscal year 2021 was $20.2 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3.2%, from $20.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The decrease primarily relates to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized during fiscal year 2020. As a percentage of total cost of revenues, intangible asset amortization within cost of revenues decreased by 0.3 percentage points from 7.7% for fiscal year 2020 to 7.4% for fiscal year 2021. As a percentage of total operating expenses, intangible asset amortization expenses within operating expenses decreased by 0.7 percentage points from 6.3% for fiscal year 2020 to 5.6% for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Intangible asset amortization for fiscal year 2020 was $20.9 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.7%, from $21.0 million for fiscal year 2019. The decrease primarily relates to the composition of intangible assets allocated to the Cerence business prior to Spin-Off. As a percentage of total cost of revenues, intangible asset amortization within cost of revenues decreased by 0.9 percentage points from 8.6% for fiscal year 2019 to 7.7% for fiscal year 2020. As a percentage of total operating expenses, intangible asset amortization expenses within operating expenses decreased by 0.2 percentage points from 6.5% for fiscal year 2019 to 6.3% for fiscal year 2020. 42 Restructuring and Other Costs, Net Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Restructuring and other costs, net for fiscal year 2021 were $5.1 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, from $16.5 million for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net was primarily driven by a $10.6 million decrease in expenditures to establish the Cerence business as a standalone public company. As a percentage of total operating expense, restructuring and other costs, net decreased by 5.9 percentage points from 8.2% for fiscal year 2020 to 2.3% for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Restructuring and other costs, net for fiscal year 2020 were $16.5 million, a decrease of $7.9 million, from $24.4 million for fiscal year 2019. Restructuring and other costs, net decreased primarily due to the winding down of separation costs to establish the Cerence business as a standalone public company, which decreased $10.8 million. The decrease was partly offset by the $3.6 million increase in severance charges related to the elimination of personnel across multiple functions and the $1.1 million increase in facilities related charges. As a percentage of total operating expense, restructuring and other costs, net decreased by 4.4 percentage points from 12.6% for fiscal year 2019 to 8.2% for fiscal year 2020. Acquisition-related Costs Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 There were no acquisition-related costs for fiscal year 2020, which resulted in a decrease of $0.9 million, from $0.9 million for fiscal year 2019. Acquisition costs decreased as a direct result of integration, legal, and other professional fees incurred resulting from the acquisition of Voicebox on April 2, 2018. As a percentage of total operating expense, acquisition-related costs decreased by 0.5 percentage points from 0.5% for fiscal year 2019 to 0.0% for fiscal year 2020. Total Other Expense, Net Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Total other expense, net for fiscal year 2021 was $12.3 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from $45.5 million of expense for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in interest expense and other income (expense), net is primarily attributed to our debt refinancing in June 2020. During fiscal year 2020, we recognized a $19.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt. 43 Fiscal Year 20 20 Compared with Fiscal Year 201 9 Total other expense, net for fiscal year 2020 was $45.5 million, an increase of $45.8 million from total other income, net of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to $22.7 million in interest expense related to our debt financings during fiscal year 2020, a $19.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to our Existing Facilities and $1.2 million of expense related to a decrease in an asset corresponding with the release of indemnified pre-Spin-Off liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 4.9%, compared to 20.5% for fiscal year 2020. Consequently, our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2021 was $2.4 million, a net change of $7.1 million, or 150.3%, from a benefit from income taxes of $4.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2021 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to our composition of jurisdictional earnings, U.S. inclusions of foreign taxable income as a result of changes in applicable tax laws in 2017, and an income tax benefit of approximately $15.9 million related to an increase in tax rates in the Netherlands enacted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was 20.5%, compared to negative 796.5% for fiscal year 2019. Consequently, our benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2020 was $4.7 million, a net change of $84.4 million, or 94.7%, from $89.1 million for fiscal year 2019. The effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2020 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to our composition of jurisdictional earnings, U.S. inclusions of foreign taxable income as a result of changes in applicable tax laws in 2017, and an income tax benefit of approximately $5.0 million related to an increase in tax rates in the Netherlands enacted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Condition As of September 30, 2021, we had $166.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities include commercial paper and corporate bonds. As of September 30, 2021, our net working capital, excluding deferred revenue and deferred costs, was $194.0 million. This balance is representative of the short-term net cash inflows based on the working capital at that date. Sources and Material Cash Requirements Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flows we generated from our operations. The primary uses of cash include costs of revenues, funding of R&amp;D activities, capital expenditures and debt obligations. Our ability to fund future operating needs will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and finance additional funding in the capital markets as needed. Based on our history of generating positive cash flows and the $166.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2021, we believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations, through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and available credit via our Revolving Facility. 44 The following table presents our material cash requirements for future periods: We sponsor certain defined benefit plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed as part of the Spin-Off or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. The aggregate net liability of our defined benefit plans as of September 30, 2021 was $8.7 million. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Should we need to secure additional sources of liquidity, we believe that we could finance our needs through the issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing through the issuance of equity securities or debt offerings on reasonable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. An extended period of economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. 3.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2025 On June 2, 2020, in an effort to refinance our debt structure, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional $25.0 million principal amount of the Notes, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $169.8 million after deducting transaction costs. We used net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay a portion of our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, dated October 1, 2019, by and among us, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent (the “Existing Facility”). The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020, at a rate of 3.00% per year. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. As of September 30, 2021, the if-converted value of the Notes exceeds its principal amount by $274.5 million. A holder of Notes may convert all or any portion of its Notes at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if we call such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing. 45 The conversion rate will initially be 26.7271 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $37.42 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its Notes called for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be. We may not redeem the Notes prior to June 5, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on a redemption date occurring on or after June 5, 2023 and on or before the 31st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. If we undergo a “fundamental change”, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The indenture governing the Notes contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes plus accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. At issuance, we accounted for the Notes by allocating proceeds from the Notes into debt and equity components according to the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be fully or partially settled in cash upon conversion. The initial carrying amount of the debt component, which approximates its fair value, was estimated by using an interest rate for nonconvertible debt, with terms similar to the Notes. The excess of the principal amount of the Notes over the fair value of the debt component was recorded as a debt discount and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. The debt discount is accreted to the carrying value of the Notes over their expected term as interest expense using the interest method. Upon issuance of the Notes, we recorded $155.3 million as debt and $19.7 million as additional paid-in capital in stockholders’ equity. We incurred transaction costs of $5.6 million relating to the issuance of the Notes. In accounting for these costs, we allocated the costs of the offering between debt and equity in proportion to the fair value of the debt and equity recognized. The transaction costs allocated to the debt component of approximately $5.0 million were recorded as a direct deduction from the face amount of the Notes and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes using the interest method. The transaction costs allocated to the equity component of approximately $0.6 million were recorded as a decrease in additional paid-in capital. The interest expense recognized related to the Notes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (dollars in thousands): The conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and the Notes were convertible as of September 30, 2021, with no Notes being converted. Whether any of the Notes will be converted in future quarters will depend on the satisfaction of one or more of the conversion conditions in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes at a time when any such Notes are convertible, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 46 Senior Credit Facilities On June 12, 2020 (the “Financing Closing Date”), in connection with our effort to refinance our existing indebtedness, we entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Borrower, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”), consisting of a four-year senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan Facility were $123.0 million, which together with proceeds from the Notes was intended to pay in full all indebtedness under the Existing Facility, and paid fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities. We also entered into a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Revolving Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”), which shall be drawn on in the event that our working capital and other cash needs are not supported by our operating cash flow. As of September 30, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions customary for financings of this type. All obligations are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and material real property, including a perfected first-priority pledge of all (or, in the case of foreign subsidiaries or subsidiaries (“FSHCO”) that own no material assets other than equity interests in foreign subsidiaries that are “controlled foreign corporations” or other FSHCOs, 65%) of the equity securities of our subsidiaries held by any loan party, subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. On December 17, 2020 (the “Amendment No. 1 Effective Date”), we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment extended the scheduled maturity date of the revolving credit and term facilities from June 12, 2024 to April 1, 2025. The Amendment revised certain interest rates in the Credit Agreement. Following delivery of a compliance certificate for the first full fiscal quarter after the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date, the applicable margins for the revolving credit and term facilities is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.75% or ABR plus 1.75%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.50% or ABR plus 1.50%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.20% or ABR plus 1.00%. As a result of the Amendment, the applicable LIBOR floor was reduced from 0.50% to 0.00%. From the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date until the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.50%. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. Total interest expense relating to the Senior Credit Facilities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $4.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, reflecting the coupon and accretion of the discount. In addition, the quarterly commitment fee required to be paid based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.500%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.450%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.400%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.350%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.300%. The Amendment revised the amount by which we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments. Through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility. From the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, with the balance payable at the maturity date thereof. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at our option without premium or penalty. We may request, and each lender may agree in its sole discretion, to extend the maturity date of all or a portion of the Senior Credit Facilities subject to certain conditions customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreement also contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event that we incur certain types of indebtedness or receives net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, in each case subject to terms and conditions customary for financings of this type. 47 The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, to designate subsidiaries as unrestricted, to make certain investments, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, or to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries’ equity interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, each tested quarterly, (1) a net secured leveraged ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00; (2) a net total leverage ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00; and (3) minimum liquidity of at least $75 million. The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type, including certain customary change of control events. As of September 30, 202 1 , we were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants. Cash Flows Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, as reflected in the audited Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $74.4 million, a net increase of $29.6 million, or 66.1%, from net cash provided by operating activities of $44.8 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to: Deferred revenue represents a significant portion of our net cash provided by operating activities and, depending on the nature of our contracts with customers, this balance can fluctuate significantly from period to period. We expect our deferred revenue balances to decrease in the future, including due to a wind-down of a legacy connected service relationship with a major OEM, since the majority of cash from the contract has been collected. We do not expect any changes in deferred revenue to affect our ability to meet our obligations. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2020 was $44.8 million, a decrease of $43.3 million, or 49.1%, from $88.1 million for fiscal year 2019. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities stems from unfavorable changes in working capital. Outflows in prepaids and other assets and accounts payable increased by $21.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The timing of billings and collections resulted in $14.3 million additional cash inflows from accounts receivable compared to prior year. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2021 was $41.6 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 35.7%, from $30.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were driven by: 48 Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was $30.7 million, an increase of $26.2 million, or 579.1%, from $4.5 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase in cash outflows is due to the purchase of property and equipment to support the standalone operations of the Company and the purchase of marketable securities, in the amount of $11.7 million. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020 Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2021 was $41.5 million, a net change of $163.1 million, from cash provided by financing activities of $121.6 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to: • $249.7 million proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Facilities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020; • $169.8 million proceeds from the issuance of the Notes during the quarter ended June 30, 2020; • $123.0 million proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Credit Facilities during the quarter ended June 30, 2020; • $27 1.6 million principal payments of long-term debt during the fiscal year 2020; • $153.0 million distribution paid to Nuance related to our Spin-Off during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020; and • $ 45.8 million payment of tax related withholdings due to the net settlement of equity awards during the fiscal year 2021. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2020 was $121.6 million, an increase of $205.1 million, or 245.5%, from net cash used in financing activities of $83.6 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase in cashflows were the result of $169.8 million net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, $123.0 million net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Credit Facilities, and $249.7 million net proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Facilities. The increase in cashflows were partly offset by $271.6 million in principal payments of long-term debt, $6.4 million payments of debt issuance costs, and the $153.0 million distribution paid to Nuance. Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Refer to Note 3 to the accompanying audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of certain issued accounting standards that have not been adopted by us and may impact our results of operations in future reporting periods. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts; accounting for deferred costs; accounting for internally developed software; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for business combinations; accounting for stock-based compensation; accounting for income taxes; accounting for leases; accounting for convertible debt; and loss contingencies. Our management bases its estimates on historical 49 experience, market participant fair value considerations, projected future cash flows, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of our operations. These policies require our most difficult and subjective judgements. Revenue Recognition We primarily derive revenue from the following sources: (1) royalty-based software license arrangements, (2) connected services, and (3) professional services. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We account for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Our arrangements with customers may contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct—that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. We recognize revenue after applying the following five steps: We allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs and consider a number of data points, including: We only include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a corresponding refund liability as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent. Revenue is recognized when control of these products or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. We assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component. Reimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration. 50 Performance Obligations License Embedded software and technology licenses operate without access to the external networks and information. Embedded licenses sold with non-distinct professional services to customize and/or integrate the underlying software and technology are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue from the combined performance obligation is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours. Revenue from distinct embedded software and technology licenses, which do not require professional services to customize and/or integrate the software license, is recognized at the point in time when the software and technology is made available to the customer and control is transferred. For income statement presentation purposes, we separate distinct embedded license revenue from professional services revenue based on their relative SSPs. Revenue from embedded software and technology licenses sold on a royalty basis, where the license of non-exclusive intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates, is recognized in the period the usage occurs in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65(A). For usage-based royalty arrangements, which include fixed consideration related to a minimum usage guarantees, the fixed consideration is recognized when the software is made available to the customer. Connected Services Connected services, which allow our customers to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a usage basis as consumed or on a fixed fee subscription basis. Subscription basis revenue represents a single promise to stand-ready to provide access to our connected services. Our connected services contract terms generally range from one to five years. As each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, we have determined that our connected services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services. These services include variable consideration, typically a function of usage. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e., recognized as incurred). Our connected service arrangements generally include services to develop, customize, and stand-up applications for each customer. In determining whether these services are distinct, we consider dependence of the cloud service on the up-front development and stand-up, as well as availability of the services from other vendors. We have concluded that the up-front development, stand-up and customization services are not distinct performance obligations, and as such, revenue for these activities is recognized over the period during which the cloud-connected services are provided, and is included within connected services revenue. There can be instances where the customer purchases a software license that allows them to take possession of the software to enable hosting by the customer or a third-party. For such arrangements, the performance obligation of the license is completed at a point in time once the customer takes possession of the software. Professional Services Revenue from distinct professional services, including training, is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours. Significant Judgements Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Our license contracts often include professional services to customize and/or integrate the licenses into the customer’s environment. Judgment is required to determine whether the license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with professional services. Furthermore, hybrid contracts that contain both embedded and connected license and professional services are analyzed to determine if the products and services are distinct or have stand=alone functionality to determine the revenue treatment. Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. When the SSP is directly observable, we estimate the SSP based upon the historical transaction prices, adjusted for geographic considerations, customer classes, and customer relationship profiles. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We may have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the 51 size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Determining the SSP for performance obligations which we never sell separately also requires significant judgment. In estimating the SSP, we consider the likely price that would have resulted from established pricing practices had the deliverable been offered separately and the prices a customer would likely be willing to pay. For contracts that contain future royalties, the allocation of SSP is determined using any fixed payments as well as the forecasted volume usage associated with royalties. Contract Acquisition Costs In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. The capitalized costs primarily relate to paid commissions. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, we apply a portfolio approach to estimate contract acquisition costs for groups of customer contracts. We elect to apply the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and will expense contract acquisition costs as incurred where the expected period of benefit is one year or less. Contract acquisition costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which we have estimated to be between one and eight years. The period of benefit was determined based on an average customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We assess the amortization term for all major transactions based on specific facts and circumstances. Contract acquisition costs are classified as current or noncurrent assets based on when the expense will be recognized. The current and noncurrent portions of contract acquisition costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and in other assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $6.9 million and $5.6 million of contract acquisition costs. We had amortization expense of $1.9 million, $1.5 million, and $0.7 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. There was no impairment related to contract acquisition costs. Capitalized Contract Costs We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Our capitalized costs consist primarily of setup costs, such as costs to standup, customize and develop applications for each customer, which are incurred to satisfy our stand-ready obligation to provide access to our connected offerings. These contract costs are expensed to cost of revenue as we satisfy our stand-ready obligation over the contract term which we estimate to be between one and eight years, on average. The contract term was determined based on an average customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology, and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We classify these costs as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current and noncurrent portions of capitalized contract fulfillment costs are presented as deferred costs. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $37.8 million and $45.4 million of capitalized contract costs. We had amortization expense of $15.4 million, $12.0 million and $10.6 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no impairment related to contract fulfillment costs capitalized. Trade Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances We classify our right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment is due). We present such receivables in Accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their net estimated realizable value. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and other applicable factors. Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not solely subject to the passage of time. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of September 30, 2021, we had $59.1 million of contract assets. Our contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenues recognized. We classify deferred revenue as current or noncurrent based on when we expect to recognize the revenues. As of September 30, 2021, we had $276.7 million of deferred revenue. 52 Business Combinations We determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions as of the date of the business acquisition, including fair value estimates such as: While we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, within the measurement period, which is generally one year from the date of acquisition, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed against goodwill in the period the amounts are determined. Adjustments identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded within Acquisition-related costs, net. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair market value of legal performance commitments to customers, which are classified as deferred revenue. The estimated fair market value of these obligations is determined and recorded as of the acquisition date. We may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair values of a pre-acquisition contingencies, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency at the end of the measurement period, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the end of the measurement period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency will be included within acquisition-related cost, net in the period in which the adjustment is determined. Goodwill Impairment Analysis Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. There was no goodwill impairment in any of the periods presented. 53 For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure. Upon consideration of our compo nents , we have concluded that our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately. Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives Our long-lived assets consist principally of technology, customer relationships, internally developed software, land, building, and equipment. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Other definite-lived assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives using the straight-line method. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically at the asset group level for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group. Internally developed software consists of capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs related design of the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized over the estimated useful life, commencing on the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. Land, building and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or retired assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations for the period. Long-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. There were no long-lived asset impairments in any of the periods presented. Stock-Based Compensation We grant equity awards to certain employees which include stock options and restricted awards in accordance with provisions of the Cerence 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“Equity Incentive Plan”). We account for stock-based compensation through recognition of the fair value of the stock-based compensation as a charge against earnings. The fair value for time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the closing share price of our common stock on the date of grant. For performance-based restricted stock units, the compensation cost is recognized based on the number of units expected to vest upon the achievement of the performance conditions. We recognize stock-based compensation as an expense on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than applying an estimated forfeiture rate. 54 Income Taxes Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 We account for income taxes using the assets and liabilities method, as prescribed by ASC No. 740, Income Taxes , or ASC 740. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carry amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowance required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our currency and deferred tax positions. Any significant fluctuations in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates. We have historically estimated the future tax consequences of certain items, including bad debts and accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent period when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured used enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the repatriations of such foreign earnings. Valuation Allowance We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historically profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Uncertain Tax Positions We operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgements and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, intercompany transfer and acquisition or divestures. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax laws is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may own may differ from the amounts recognized. Fiscal year 2019 Income taxes as presented herein attribute current and deferred income taxes of Nuance to the Cerence business’s standalone financial statements in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. Accordingly, the Cerence business’s income tax provision was prepared following the “Separate Return Method.” The Separate Return Method applies ASC 740 to the standalone financial statements of each member of the consolidated group as if the group member were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise. As a result, actual tax transactions included in the consolidated financial statements of Nuance may not be included in the combined financial statements of the Cerence business. Similarly, the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the combined financial statements of Cerence may not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements 55 and tax returns of Nuance; therefore, such items as net operating losses, credit carryforwards and valuation allowances may exist in the standalone financial statements that may or may not exist in Nuance’s consolidated financial statements. The breadth of the Cerence business’s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes that the Cerence business would have paid if it had been a separate taxpayer. The final taxes that would have been paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The provision for income taxes was determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits relating to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. The provision for income taxes represented income taxes paid by Nuance or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the Cerence business’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weights assigned to the positive and negative evidence are commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed, it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. In general, the taxable income (loss) of the various Cerence business entities was included in Nuance’s consolidated tax returns, where applicable in jurisdictions around the world. As such, separate income tax returns were not prepared for any Cerence business entities. Consequently, income taxes currently payable are deemed to have been remitted to Nuance, in cash, in the period the liability arose and income taxes currently receivable are deemed to have been received from Nuance in the period that a refund could have been recognized by the Cerence business had the Cerence business been a separate taxpayer. Leases We have entered into a number of facility and equipment leases which qualify as operating leases under GAAP. We also have a limited number of equipment leases that also qualify as finance leases. We determine if contracts with vendors represent a lease or have a lease component under GAAP at contract inception. Our leases have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to seven years. Some of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right of use assets, Short-term operating lease liabilities, and Long-term operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. Finance leases are included in Property and equipment, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. Lease costs for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For operating leases, costs are included within Cost of revenues, Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. For financing leases, amortization of the finance right of use assets is included within Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, and interest expense is included within Interest expense. For operating leases, the related cash payments are included in the operating cash flows on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. For financing leases, the related cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are included in the financing cash flows on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows and the related cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability are included in the operating cash flows on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows. Convertible Debt We bifurcate the debt and equity (the contingently convertible feature) components of our convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity components of our convertible debt instruments are recorded within stockholders’ equity with an allocated issuance premium or discount. The debt issuance premium or discount is amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations using the effective interest method over the expected term of the convertible debt. 56 We assess the short-term and long-term classification of our convertible debt on each balance sheet date. Whenever the holders have a contractual right to convert, the carrying amount of the convertible debt is reclassified to current liabilities , with the corresponding equity components classified from additional paid-in-capital to mezzanine equity, as needed. Loss Contingencies We may be subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service, intellectual property, and other matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgments are required for the determination of probability and the range of the outcomes. Due to the inherent uncertainties, estimates are based only on the best information available at the time. Actual outcomes may differ from our estimates. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.","Cerence builds AI powered virtual assistants for the mobility/transportation market.

The company has existing relationships with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers, and while its customer contracts vary, they generally represent multi-year engagements, giving us visibility into future revenue.
The company experienced total revenue growth of 17.0% and 9.1%, during fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively, primarily driven by its connected and professional services revenues due to increased market penetration of the company’s connected and professional services solutions. License revenues increased during fiscal 2021 due to higher volume of licensing royalties as the global auto industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and OEMs increased production. During fiscal year 2021, total cost of revenues decreased by 6.3%, primarily driven by the company’s cost savings initiatives. Total operating expenses grew by 12.4% during fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by innovation initiatives in order to increase the company’s competitive position in the market. The company’s R&D expenses increased 26.1%, as its R&D and engineering workforces refocused on developing new products and advancing our core technologies.
For the fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020:
 	•	Total revenue increased by $56.2 million, or 17.0%, from $331.0 million to $387.2 million.

 	•	Operating margin increased 8.9 percentage points from 6.8% to 15.7%.

 	•	Cash provided by operating activities increased by $29.6 million, or 66.1%, from $44.8 million to $74.4 million.
For fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019:
 	•	Total revenue increased by $27.7 million, or 9.1%, from $303.3 million to $331.0 million.

 	•	Operating margin increased by 3.2 percentage points from 3.6% to 6.8%.

 	•	Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $43.3 million, or 49.1%, from $88.1 million to $44.8 million.

As of September 30, 2021, the company had $166.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2021, the company’s net working capital, excluding deferred revenue and deferred costs, was $194.0 million. This balance is representative of the short-term net cash inflows based on the working capital at that date.
On June 2, 2020, in an effort to refinance its debt structure, the company issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional $25.0 million principal amount of the Notes, between the company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $169.8 million after deducting transaction costs. The company used net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay a portion of its indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, dated October 1, 2019. On June 12, 2020 (the “Financing Closing Date”), in connection with the company’s effort to refinance its existing indebtedness, the company entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Borrower, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”), consisting of a four-year senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan Facility were $123.0 million, which together with proceeds from the Notes was intended to pay in full all indebtedness under the Existing Facility, and paid fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities. The company also entered into a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Revolving Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”), which shall be drawn on in the event that the company’s working capital and other cash needs are not supported by our operating cash flow. As of September 30, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility.
Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $74.4 million, a net increase of $29.6 million, or 66.1%, from net cash provided by operating activities of $44.8 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to:
 	•	An increase of $62.0 million from income before non-cash charges

 	•	A decrease of $22.7 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital primarily related to cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities; and

 	•	A decrease of $9.7 million from changes in deferred revenue.

Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2021 was $41.6 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 35.7%, from $30.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were driven by:
 	•	$26.1 million net purchase of marketable securities for fiscal year 2021

 	•	$2.6 million paid in connection with equity investments during the fiscal year 2021

 	•	$2.0 million paid related to debt securities; and

 	•	A decrease of $7.0 million in capital expenditures.

Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2021 was $41.5 million, a net change of $163.1 million, from cash provided by financing activities of $121.6 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to:
•$249.7 million proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Facilities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020;
•$169.8 million proceeds from the issuance of the Notes during the quarter ended June 30, 2020;
•$123.0 million proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Credit Facilities during the quarter ended June 30, 2020;
•$271.6 million principal payments of long-term debt during the fiscal year 2020;
•$153.0 million distribution paid to Nuance related to our Spin-Off during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020; and
•$45.8 million payment of tax related withholdings due to the net settlement of equity awards during the fiscal year 2021.

We have historically been taxed as an S-Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for income tax purposes in most states. As a result, net income or loss has been allocated to our stockholders and included on their individual income tax returns prior to July 27, 2020. Effective July 27, 2020 we converted to a C-Corporation, which has resulted in our net income or losses for all future periods to be taxed at the corporate level. As such, our income tax provision will not be comparable for periods prior to the C-Corporation conversion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $24.9 million specifically associated with our conversion to a C-Corporation. On July 28, 2020, the Company effected the Recapitalization, which included effecting the Stock Split, establishing the New Capital Structure and effecting the Share Exchange. The effect of the Stock Split and the Share Exchange are recognized retrospectively in our consolidated financial statements. Historical earnings per share information for all periods presented prior to the Offering was retrospectively restated. Our Registration Statement was declared effective on July 28, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the Company receiving $423.0 million in proceeds from the sale of 23,812,216 shares of Class A common stock at an Offering price of $19.00 per share, net of underwriting fees. After payment of Offering costs of $6.2 million, the Company used a portion of the proceeds to pay off $175.0 million in outstanding debt. The net proceeds remaining after these payments are being used for working capital and other corporate purposes. Key Factors Affecting Performance The growth of our business and our future success depends on many factors, including our ability to retain and expand our revenues from existing customers, acquire new customers, broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem, continually innovate our software, invest in growth and scale our business and manage customer migrations to cloud solutions. While these areas represent significant opportunities for us, we also face significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount. The expected addition of new personnel and the investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth may make it more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. 28 Retention and expansion of revenues from existing customers. Given the breadth of our customer base and their own internal growth, the majority of our revenues and revenue growth comes from existing customers. This revenue growth is comprised of the acquisition of new licenses for additional products, increases in subscription fees due to expanded usage of currently licensed software and price increases. We plan to continue to invest in new innovations and offerings and in our sales and marketing teams in order to support the ongoing strong retention and expansion of revenues with our existing customers. We monitor our net revenue retention rate (“NRR”) in order to understand our ability to retain and grow revenues from our customers. Our NRR was 106%, 109% and 104% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics – Net Revenue Retention Rate” for further discussion. Acquire new customers. Our solutions address the complexity of aligning commerce and compliance and we believe the market for our software and solutions is large and underpenetrated, both in the U.S. and globally. As enterprise and mid-market companies continue to expand their business operations—both through their product and service offerings and their global footprint—we expect demand for our tax solutions to increase due to the fact that legacy solutions such as spreadsheets, manual processes, native ERP functionality or home-built solutions are error prone, inefficient and cannot scale. We plan to continue to invest in our sales and marketing teams and our solution development in order to address this increased demand from new customers. This increased investment will result in increases in expenses in advance of revenues attributable to these investments. Broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem. We have an extensive network of partners that spans ERP, CRM, procurement, billing, POS and eCommerce platforms. Our partners enhance the coverage and adoption of our solutions and promote our thought leadership. We leverage our partnerships to maximize the benefits of our solutions for our customers and to identify new customer opportunities. By forming additional strategic alliances with participants in the global digital transformation, such as payments and eCommerce platforms, we can continue to expand our exposure to all transactions, both business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”). Future partnerships with large-scale digital payments companies will allow us to develop additional customer-centric solutions and further expand our customer base. Continued innovation of our software. With the pace of change in commerce and compliance, we believe it is important to continue innovating and extending the functionality and breadth of our software. We plan on investing to further enhance our content and the speed and usability of our software. Historically such innovation has been accomplished through internal development efforts. However, we may pursue acquisitions, development arrangements with partners or similar activities to accelerate these investments. On January 25, 2021, we acquired Tellutax, a designer of edge-based technology utilizing a container architecture, which enables customers to deliver tax solutions seamlessly at the point of need with increased scalability and simplified management. We believe continuing to enhance our existing software and expanding our tax content will increase our ability to generate revenues by broadening the appeal of our software to new customers as well as increasing our engagement with existing customers. Investing in growth and scaling our business. We believe that our market opportunity is large, and we will continue to invest significantly in scaling across organizational functions in order to support the anticipated growth in our operations both domestically and internationally. Any investments we make in our research and development and our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating resources in those areas. The company may pursue acquisitions or partner arrangements to accelerate its growth initiatives. On January 7, 2020, we acquired Systax Sistemas Fiscais LTDA (“Systax”), a provider of Brazilian transaction tax content and software. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Customer migration to cloud solutions. Over time, we expect a continued shift to our cloud solutions from existing and newly acquired customers. Generally, when existing customers migrate from on-premise to cloud-based solutions, this generally has a favorable impact on our long-term ARR due to price structures and opportunities to promote additional license sales. Over the past three years, cloud sales to new customers have grown at a significantly faster rate than sales of on-premise solutions, which is a trend that we expect to continue over time. We generated 12.9%, 19.1% and 27.5% of software subscription revenues from cloud-based subscriptions in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We recognize revenue from the sale of cloud-based subscriptions ratably over the life of the contract, whereas for on-premise subscriptions, the first year pricing includes a premium that is not included in future renewal pricing. The premium is recognized ratably over the estimated period of benefit to the customer, which is generally three years. Therefore, as more of our sales shift to cloud-based subscriptions, our revenue growth rate may increase. We provide hosting for our cloud- 29 based subscriptions. To the extent that revenues from our cloud offerings increase as a percentage of total revenues, our gross margin may decrease due to the associated hosting costs of those offerings. Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19 During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on our revenues and results of operations, as we continue to derive the significant majority of our revenues from our existing software subscriptions. As we principally price our solutions based on our customers’ revenues within certain revenue bands, elongated declines in our existing customers’ revenues may impact our ability to grow our existing customer revenues. We did not experience an abnormal number of non-renewals in 2020, nor any material declines in revenues associated with declines in our customers’ revenues, and we currently expect our existing customer base to remain largely stable, as it did through the recession in 2008 and 2009. However, significant increases in non-renewals or concessions to renewal customers would have a material impact on our revenues and cash flows. During 2020, we did see some delays in signing deals due to prospects shifting to working remotely, and some due to economic uncertainty. We expect that the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our billings to new customers beyond 2020 as the pandemic continues to generate economic uncertainty, and it may also negatively impact our efforts to maintain or expand revenues from our existing customers as they continue to evaluate certain long-term projects and budget constraints. However, we do not anticipate that overall demand for our software and solutions, our ability to deliver such software and solutions, or our growth strategies will be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies continue to rely on us for their indirect tax solutions. Our cash collections for the year were consistent with our expectations as some of the procedural disruptions that customers experienced as they shifted to remote work early in the year stabilized by the end of 2020. We believe that we may see delays in collections in 2021 as the pandemic continues to generate economic uncertainty. However, we do not believe that these delays will materially impact our business; we continue to expect that we will be able to collect amounts due under subscription contracts from customers experiencing issues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have not recorded an additional allowance for doubtful accounts in connection with any delays. Given that customers cannot forgo our monthly content updates, which are necessary to remain compliant with the most current regulations, we believe customers will continue to pay our renewal invoices in a timely, even if slightly elongated, manner. We believe that we currently have ample liquidity and capital resources to continue to meet our operating needs, and our ability to continue to service our debt or other financial obligations is not currently impaired. For a further description of our liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot reliably be predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business and government spending on technology as well as customers’ ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including estimated allowance for subscription cancellations, product life cycles and estimated useful lives and potential impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill. Key Business Metrics We regularly review several metrics identified below to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Annual Recurring Revenue. We derive the vast majority of our revenues from recurring software subscriptions. We believe ARR provides us with visibility to our projected software subscription revenues in order to evaluate the health of our business. Because we recognize subscription revenues ratably, we believe investors can use ARR to measure our expansion of existing customer revenues, new customer activity, and as an indicator of future software subscription revenues. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenues (“MRR”) from software subscriptions for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. MRR is calculated by dividing the software subscription price, inclusive of discounts, 30 by the number of subscription covered months. MRR only includes customers with MRR at the end of the last month of the measurement period. ​ ​ ARR increased by $37.9 million or 13.6% from 2019 to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by $17.5 million of growth in revenues from existing customers through their expanded use of our solutions as well as price increases, and $20.4 million of on-premise and cloud-based subscriptions of our tax solutions to new customers. ARR increased by $45.0 million or 19.2% from 2018 to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by $21.6 million of growth in revenues from existing customers through their expanded use of our solutions as well as price increases, and $23.4 million of on-premise and cloud-based subscriptions of our tax solutions to new customers. Net Revenue Retention Rate. We believe that our NRR provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenues from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. We also believe it demonstrates to investors our ability to expand existing customer revenues, which is one of our key growth strategies. Our NRR refers to the ARR expansion during the 12 months of a reporting period for all customers who were part of our customer base at the beginning of the reporting period. Our NRR calculation takes into account any revenues lost from departing customers or customers who have downgraded or reduced usage, as well as any revenue expansion from migrations, new licenses for additional products or contractual and usage-based price changes. ​ ​ The 300 basis point decrease in NRR from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales growth to existing customers as compared to the prior year related to delays in signing deals due to their focus shifting to working remotely, and economic uncertainty in connection with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses. The 500 basis point increase in NRR from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by growth of $21.6 million in recurring subscription revenues from existing customers through their expanded use of our solutions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are measures widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our Company and other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance as they measure business performance focusing on cash-related charges and because they are important metrics to lenders under our credit agreements. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude charges for asset impairments, stock-based compensation expense, severance charges, and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues for the same period. The following schedules reconcile Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss), the most closely directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For more information about how we use these and other non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see “Management’s 31 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” ​ The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $10.5 million in 2020 is primarily driven by an increase of $36.8 million in non-GAAP gross profit, partially offset by increases in various non-GAAP operating expense categories including $13.2 million in non-GAAP general and administrative expense, $10.0 million in non-GAAP research and development expense, and $3.5 million in non-GAAP selling and marketing expense. Growth in these operating expense categories is driven primarily by our ongoing investment in our research and development, sales and marketing teams and technology infrastructure to support current and future growth. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million in 2019 is primarily driven by an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase in operating expenses including additional sales and marketing and research and development investments. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased in 2020 and 2019 by 20 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, in comparison to the immediately preceding period, primarily because operating expenses increased at a higher rate than our increase in revenue, driven by our previously noted investments to enable future growth. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin. Our management uses free cash flow as a critical measure in the evaluation of liquidity in conjunction with related GAAP amounts. We also use the measure when considering available cash, including for decision making purposes related to dividends and discretionary investments. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure for investors because it measures the amount of cash we generate from our operations after our capital expenditures and capitalization of software development costs. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on free cash flow and free cash flow margin. We define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the redemption of stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) in 2020 in connection with the Offering reflected as a reduction of cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenues for the same period. The following schedule reconciles free cash flow and free cash flow margin to net cash provided by operating activities, the most closely directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For more information about how we use these and other non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations 32 to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures . ” ​ ​ Free cash flow decreased by $5.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by a net decrease of $10.1 million in cash provided by operating activities, after reflecting the addback of $22.9 million in cash consumed by the redemption of SARs converted to stock options and subsequently redeemed in the Offering (“Converted SARs”), which was partially offset by a year over year reduction in cash consumed by investments in on-premise capitalized software development of $5.4 million. This decrease in on-premise capitalized software development costs is associated with the continued shift in our development efforts to cloud-based solutions. Investments in cloud-based solutions increased by $4.5 million in 2020 over 2019 and are included in internal use software as additions to property and equipment. These increased investments in cloud-based solutions offset the reductions in investments in other property and equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flow from operating activities, excluding the impact of the Converted SARs, were unfavorably impacted during the 2020 period as a result of an increase in costs associated with increased development activity associated with nascent technologies, and comparatively lower cash generated through changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenues as a result of timing, sales mix and differences in customer payment terms. Cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by our expansion of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 of $10.5 million as previously discussed. Free cash flow margin decreased in 2020 by 390 basis points compared to 2019, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations noted above during a period of expansion of total revenues of $53.2 million. Free cash flow increased by $7.8 million in 2019 over 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash from operating activities of $12.0 million, due to a $4.5 million increase in net income after excluding the impact of the asset impairment in 2018 and an increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. This amount is offset by an increase of $5.0 million in investments in capitalized software costs to support the growth of our customers. Free cash flow margin remained relatively consistent with the prior year at approximately 17%. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenues We generate revenues from software subscriptions and services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for subscription and non-renewal cancellations and any taxes collected from customers that are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Software Subscriptions Licenses for on-premise software subscriptions, which are generally one year, provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers purchase a subscription to these licenses, which includes the related software and tax content updates and product support. The updates and support, which are part 33 of the subscription agreement, are essential to the continued utility of the software; therefore, we have determined the software and the related updates and support to be a single performance obligation. Accordingly, when on-premise software is licensed, the revenue associated with this combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the license term as these subscriptions are provided for the duration of the license term. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the software is made available to the customer to download. Our on-premise software subscription prices in the initial subscription year are higher than standard renewal prices. The excess initial year price over the renewal price is a material right that provides customers with the right to this reduced renewal price. We recognize revenue associated with this material right over the estimated period of benefit to the customer, which is generally three years. Our cloud-based subscriptions allow customers to use Company-hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. The contracts are generally for one to three years and are generally billed annually in advance of the subscription period. Our cloud-based offerings also include related updates and support. All services within the cloud-based contracts consistently provide a benefit to the customer during the subscription period, thus the associated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the customer is provided access to the cloud-based solutions. Revenue is impacted by the timing of sales and our customers’ growth or contractions resulting in their need to expand or contract their subscription usage, the purchase of new solutions or the non-renewal of existing solutions. In addition, revenue will fluctuate with the cessation of extended product support fees charged for older versions of our software subscription solutions when they are retired and these fees are no longer charged. Contracts for on-premise licenses permit cancellations at the end of the license term, which is generally one year. Legacy cloud-based subscription contracts for multi-year periods previously provided customers the right to terminate their contract for services prior to the end of the subscription period at a significant penalty. This penalty requires the payment of a percentage of the remaining months of the then current contract term. Current cloud-based contracts do not contain such termination rights. Terminations of cloud-based subscriptions prior to the end of the subscription term have occurred infrequently and the impact has been immaterial. The allowance for subscription and non-renewal cancellations reflects an estimate of the amount of such cancellations and non-renewals based upon our historical experience. Services We generate services revenues primarily in support of our customers’ needs associated with our software and to enable them to realize the full benefit of our solutions. These software subscription-related services include configuration, data migration and implementation, and premium support and training. In addition, we generate services revenues through our managed services offering which allows customers to outsource all or a portion of their indirect tax operations to us. These services include indirect tax return preparation, filing and tax payment and notice management. We generally bill for services on a per-transaction or time and materials basis, and we recognize revenue from deliverable-based professional services as services are performed. Fluctuations in services revenues are typically directly correlated to fluctuations in our subscription revenues with respect to implementation and training services as we have historically experienced an attachment rate to subscription sales for these services in excess of 60%. However, demand for services in 2020 exceeded historical levels as certain customers migrated to a newer version of the software which is not expected to be a significant driver of our services revenues growth in 2021. In addition, and to a lesser extent, our managed services offering has continued to experience increased revenues associated with returns processing volume increases attributable to regulatory changes, as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions. Cost of Revenues Software Subscriptions Cost of software subscriptions revenues consists of costs related to providing and supporting our software subscriptions and includes personnel and related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. In addition, cost of revenues includes direct costs associated with information technology, such as data center and software hosting costs, and tax content maintenance. Cost of revenues also includes amortization associated with direct labor and related expenses for capitalized internal-use software and developed software for new products and enhancements to existing products and cloud-based subscription solutions, and costs associated with the amortization of 34 acquired intangible assets. We plan to continue to significantly expand our infrastructure and personnel to support our future growth and increases in transaction volumes of our cloud-based solutions, including through acquisitions. We expect growth in our business will result in an increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars. Services Cost of services revenues consists of direct costs of software subscription-related services and our managed services offering. These costs include personnel and related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and the cost of third-party contractors and other direct expenses. We plan to continue to expand our infrastructure and personnel as necessary to support our future growth and related increases in our service revenues. We expect growth in our business will result in an increase in the cost of services revenues in absolute dollars but may decrease as a percentage of revenues as we scale our operations. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our research and development activities, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party developers and other contractors. Research and development costs, other than software development expenses qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $11.9 million, $17.2 million and $12.3 million of software development costs were capitalized, respectively. Capitalized software development costs consist primarily of employee-related and third-party labor costs. We devote substantial resources to developing new products and enhancing existing products, conducting quality assurance testing and improving our core technology. We believe continued investments in research and development are critical to attain our strategic objectives and expect research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars. These investments include enhancing our solution offerings to address changing customer needs to support their growth, as well as implementing changes required to keep pace with our partners’ technology to ensure the continued ability of our solutions to work together and deliver value to our customers. The market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, changing customer demands and evolving industry standards. As a result, although we are making significant research and development expenditures, which may be incurred and certain of which may be capitalized, there is no guarantee these solutions will be accepted by the market. This could result in increased costs or an impairment of capitalized development costs with no resulting future revenue benefit. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses in support of sales and marketing efforts. These costs include salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. In addition, selling expense includes costs related to advertising and promotion efforts, branding costs, partner-based commissions, costs associated with our annual customer conferences, and the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities in the future to continue to increase our brand awareness and expect these costs to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we grow our business and continue to expand our market and partner ecosystem penetration. Sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for administrative, finance, information technology, legal, risk management, facilities and human resources staffing, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, severance, stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, facility costs and other internal support costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations, hire additional personnel, integrate future acquisitions and incur additional costs associated with becoming a publicly listed company. As a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses related to accounting, tax and 35 auditing activities, legal, insurance, SEC and internal control compliance, including the design, implementation and testing of increasingly formalized systems of internal control over financial reporting. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation of purchased and developed asset costs over the future periods benefitted by the use of these assets. These assets include leasehold improvements for our facilities, computers and equipment needed to support our customers and our internal infrastructure and capitalized internal-use software associated with our internal infrastructure and tools. Depreciation and amortization will fluctuate in correlation with our ongoing investment in internal infrastructure costs to support our growth. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net reflects the amount of our interest expense that exceeds interest income over the same period. Interest expense consists primarily of interest payments and other financing costs on our debt facility. Interest expense includes write-downs of deferred financing costs upon redemption of debt. Interest expense will vary as a result of fluctuations in the level of debt outstanding as well as interest rates on such debt. In addition, interest expense will include adjustments to the fair value of contracts that may be entered into to hedge risks associated with currency fluctuations for cash receipts or cash payments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and which do not qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, changes in the settlement value of the future payment obligation for the Systax acquisition will be recorded as interest expense, as described further in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest income reflects earnings on investments of our cash on hand and on funds held for customers related to our managed outsourcing services. Interest income will vary as a result of fluctuations in the future level of funds available for investment and the rate of return available in the market on such funds. Provision for Taxes Prior to July 27, 2020, we have been taxed as an S-Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for income tax purposes in most states. As a result, net income or loss prior to this date has been allocated to our stockholders and included on their individual income tax returns. In certain states, we have been taxed at the corporate level. Accordingly, the income tax provision or benefit for such periods was based on taxable income allocated to those states. In certain foreign jurisdictions, our subsidiaries were also taxed at the corporate level. Similar to states, the income tax provision or benefit is based on taxable income sourced to these foreign jurisdictions. Effective July 27, 2020 we converted to a C-Corporation, which has resulted in our net income or losses for all future periods being taxed at the corporate level. As such, our income tax provision will not be comparable for periods prior to the C-Corporation conversion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $24.9 million specifically associated with our conversion to a C-Corporation. 36 Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods. In particular, in connection with the Offering, we converted to a C-Corporation, which will result in taxation at the corporate level. The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated. Revenues are reflected in accordance with ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018. ​ ​ 37 ​ The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented. ​ Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenues ​ Revenues increased $53.2 million, or 16.5%, to $374.7 million in 2020 compared to $321.5 million in 2019. The increase in software subscriptions revenues of $41.1 million, or 14.9%, was primarily driven by an increase of $37.5 million in revenues derived from our existing customers and a year over year increase of $3.6 million in revenues derived from new customers. 38 The $12.0 million increase in services revenues is primarily driven by an increase of $9.8 million in software subscription-related services associated with the growth in subscription revenues, which includes new customers implementing our solutions and upgrading existing customers to newer versions of our solutions. In addition, our managed services offering experienced a $2.2 million increase in recurring services revenues over the prior year due to returns processing volume increases related to regulatory changes as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions. Cost of Software Subscriptions Revenues ​ Cost of software subscriptions revenues increased $28.4 million, or 36.8%, to $105.7 million in 2020 compared to $77.3 million in 2019. Of this increase, 48.3% is due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $13.7 million. After excluding the impact of stock-based compensation there is a remaining increase of $14.7 million. Of this increase, $3.7 million is due to increased amortization expense associated with the late Q3 2019 release of O Series 9.0. The remaining $11.0 million variance is primarily associated with increased costs of personnel supporting year-over-year growth of sales and customers and ongoing infrastructure investments to support expansion of customer transaction volumes for our cloud-based subscription customers. As a percentage of total revenues, the cost of software subscriptions revenues increased to 28.2% in 2020 compared to 24.0% in 2019. Adjusting for the increase in stock-based compensation in 2020, cost of software subscriptions revenues as a percentage of total revenues would have been 24.5% in 2020. Cost of Services Revenues ​ Cost of services revenues increased $26.6 million, or 80.3%, to $59.7 million in 2020 compared to $33.1 million in 2019. Of this increase, 75.4% is due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $20.1 million. After excluding the impact of stock-based compensation there is a remaining increase of $6.5 million primarily due to headcount growth in the service delivery areas to support revenue growth in software subscription-related services and our managed services offering. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of services revenues increased to 15.9% in 2020 compared to 10.3% in 2019. Adjusting for the increase in stock-based compensation in 2020, cost of services revenues as a percentage of total revenues would have been 10.6% in 2020. Research and Development ​ Research and development expenses increased $23.8 million, or 77.8%, to $54.3 million in 2020 compared to $30.6 million in 2019. Of this increase, 57.8% is due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $13.7 million. After excluding the impact of stock-based compensation there is a remaining increase of $10.1 million. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with increased development activity associated with nascent technologies and new solutions to address end-to-end data analysis and compliance needs of our customers. As a percentage of total revenues, research and development expenses increased to 14.5% in 2020 compared to 9.5% in 2019. Adjusting for the increase in stock-based compensation in 2020, research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue would have been 10.8% in 2020. 39 Selling and Marketing ​ Selling and marketing expenses increased $31.3 million, or 45.9%, to $99.4 million in 2020 compared to $68.1 million in 2019. Of this increase, 88.4% is due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $27.7 million. After excluding the impact of stock-based compensation there is a remaining increase of $3.6 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses to support the growth in year-over-year subscription and services revenues and expansion of our partner and channel management programs. In addition, we expanded our promotional and brand awareness efforts to support sales growth. Partially offsetting these increases, we experienced a reduction in travel and external marketing events in 2020 due to COVID-19 travel and conference restrictions. These costs are expected to increase once travel and conference restrictions are lifted, although it is uncertain whether these costs will return to their historical levels experienced pre-COVID-19. As a percentage of total revenues, selling and marketing expenses increased to 26.5% in 2020 compared to 21.2% in 2019. Adjusting for the increase in stock-based compensation in 2020, selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues would have been 19.2% in 2020. General and Administrative ​ General and administrative expenses increased $78.0 million, or 109.9%, to $149.1 million in 2020 compared to $71.0 million in 2019. Of this increase, 81.1% is due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $63.3 million. After excluding the impact of stock-based compensation there is a remaining increase of $14.7 million. The increase was primarily due to planned strategic investments in information technology infrastructure to drive automation and modernization of our infrastructure, combined with other continuing initiatives to support future operating leverage. Lastly, there were investments in employees and other systems and resources in support of our growth. Due to these factors, as a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 39.8% in 2020 compared to 22.1% in 2019. Adjusting for the increase in stock-based compensation in 2020, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue would have been 22.9%. Depreciation and Amortization ​ Depreciation and amortization increased $2.0 million, or 22.5%, to $11.0 million in 2020 compared to $9.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of infrastructure and technology purchases placed in service in 2019 and other capitalized infrastructure costs to support our growth. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased to 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2.8% in 2019. 40 Interest Expense, Net ​ Interest expense increased $2.2 million, or 226.4%, to $3.1 million in 2020 compared to $1.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the write-down of deferred financing fees of $1.4 million in connection with the July 2020 payoff of the $175.0 million term loan facility with a portion of the proceeds from the Offering. Additionally, interest income decreased $0.5 million in 2020 primarily due to a significant reduction in investment rates of return on cash balances which we believe was attributable to Federal Reserve actions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision for Taxes ​ Income tax benefit increased $28.8 million to $28.9 million in 2020 compared to $0.2 million in 2019. The change in tax benefit was primarily driven by the establishment of deferred tax assets at the higher C-Corporation tax rate in connection with our conversion to a C-Corporation on July 27, 2020, resulting in a benefit of $24.9 million being recorded in 2020. The substantial increases in stock-based compensation expense led to an overall pretax loss in 2020, thereby increasing our deferred tax assets and the recognition of an increased income tax benefit in 2020 at the higher C-Corporation tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenues ​ Revenues increased $49.1 million, or 18.0%, to $321.5 million in 2019 compared to $272.4 million in 2018. The increase in software subscriptions revenues of $40.0 million, or 17.0%, was primarily driven by $29.0 million in revenue growth derived from our existing customers and $11.0 million of revenues from new customers. The $9.1 million increase in services revenues is primarily driven by an increase of $5.3 million in software subscription-related services associated with the growth in subscription revenues, which includes new customers implementing our solutions and upgrading existing customers to newer versions of our solutions. In addition, our managed services offering experienced a $2.5 million increase in recurring services revenues over the prior year due to returns processing volume increases related to regulatory changes as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions. Cost of Software Subscriptions Revenues ​ Cost of software subscriptions revenues increased $8.3 million, or 12.1%, to $77.3 million in 2019 compared to $68.9 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to costs of personnel supporting year-over-year growth of sales and 41 customers, as well as ongoing infrastructure investments to support expansion of customer transaction volumes for our cloud-based subscription customers. Specifically, services headcount grew by 34% in 2019 as compared to 2018. As a percentage of total revenues, the cost of software subscriptions revenues decreased to 24.0% in 2019 compared to 25.3% in 2018. Cost of Services Revenues ​ Cost of services revenues increased $6.4 million, or 23.8%, to $33.1 million in 2019 compared to $26.8 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to headcount growth in the service delivery areas to support revenue growth in software subscription-related services and our managed services offering. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of services revenues increased to 10.3% in 2019 compared to 9.8% in 2018. Research and Development ​ Research and development expenses increased $6.8 million, or 28.6%, to $30.6 million in 2019 compared to $23.8 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with increased development activity associated with nascent technologies and new solutions to address end-to-end data analysis and compliance needs of our customers. As a percentage of total revenues, research and development expenses increased to 9.5% in 2019 compared to 8.7% in 2018, driven in part by our expanded investment in developing our global compliance reporting solution. Selling and Marketing ​ Selling and marketing expenses increased $11.2 million, or 19.7%, to $68.1 million in 2019 compared to $56.9 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with the growth in year-over-year subscription and services revenues and expansion of our partner and channel management programs. In addition, increases in advertising and promotional spending and expanded brand awareness efforts contributed to this increase. As a percentage of total revenues, selling and marketing expenses increased to 21.2% in 2019 compared to 20.9% in 2018. General and Administrative ​ General and administrative expenses increased $12.1 million, or 20.5%, to $71.0 million in 2019 compared to $59.0 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to planned strategic investments of $6.8 million in information technology infrastructure, business process reengineering and other initiatives to drive future operating leverage, as well as investments aggregating $3.7 million in employees and other systems and resources in support of our growth. 42 Due to these factors, as a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 22.1% in 2019 compared to 21.6% in 2018. Depreciation and Amortization ​ Depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 13.3%, to $9.0 million in 2019 compared to $7.9 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to the impact of infrastructure and technology purchases placed in service in 2018 and 2019 and other capitalized infrastructure costs to support our growth. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 2.8% in 2019 compared to 2.9% in 2018. Impairment of Asset During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $32.7 million for capitalized internal-use software previously utilized to provide cloud-based services to customers, net of accumulated amortization of $11.9 million. This impairment was related to a product strategy shift that resulted in this cloud offering no longer being made available for sale to customers after 2018. The capitalized development costs were deemed to be fully impaired due to the net book value of the asset exceeding its future expected cash flows. Interest Expense, Net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $0.6 million, or 40.2%, to $1.0 million in 2019 compared to $1.6 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to increases in interest income through returns earned on higher balances of cash on hand available for investment and increase in funds held for customers during 2019. Interest expense was relatively consistent with the prior year, reflecting only a slight decrease primarily due to the decrease in outstanding balance of debt due to principal payments made during 2019. Provision for Taxes ​ Provision for taxes decreased $1.8 million, or 109.2%, to an income tax benefit of $0.2 million in 2019 compared to income tax expense of $1.7 million in 2018. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a $1.0 million charge in 2018 to establish deferred taxes for assets that were transferred to the U.S. from a taxing jurisdiction that had a 0% tax rate. 43 Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods presented, as well as the percentage of total revenues that each line item represented for each quarter. In management’s opinion, the data below have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and reflect all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year or any future period. Historical periods are also impacted by acquisitions. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 44 ​ ​ The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented. ​ ​ 45 The following table sets forth our quarterly earnings per share information for the periods presented. ​ 46 Seasonality and Quarterly Trends We have historically signed a higher percentage of software subscription agreements with new and existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year. This can be attributed to buying patterns typical in the software industry. Since most of our customer agreement terms are annual, agreements initially entered into in the fourth quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. As a result, customer agreement cancellations may have a higher concentration during the end of the year. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues, though the impact to overall annual or quarterly revenues is typically minimal since we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract. Additionally, this seasonality is reflected in commission expenses to our sales personnel and our partners. Our quarterly revenues have generally increased over the last two years primarily due to new sales to existing customers and sales to new customers. However, the pace of our revenue growth has not been consistent. Many of our customers are enterprise and large corporations and their purchase patterns can be sensitive to timing of budget decisions. Depending on such timing, these decisions can create volatility in the amount of business transacted by our salesforce and the amount of revenues recorded in each quarter. As such, certain periods may be less comparable due to the timing of our customers purchase patterns. Our operating expenses generally have increased over the two-year period due to increases in headcount and related expenses to support our growth. Quarterly fluctuations in our costs and expenses overall primarily reflect changes in our headcount, and other costs related to certain technology development projects and the development and scaling of our cloud solutions. In particular, research and development expenses have fluctuated based on the timing of personnel additions, capitalized costs and related spending on product development. Increases in our selling and marketing expenses primarily reflect personnel additions and various sales and marketing initiatives, the timing of which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We anticipate our operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we invest in the long-term growth of our business. We have used stock-based compensation programs as a component of overall compensation expense for certain of our employees. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $147.9 million and $9.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Prior to the Offering, certain of these programs required the appreciation in value of our common stock underlying the related awards to be recorded as compensation expense at each measurement date for services rendered by participants over the requisite service period for such awards. Beginning in the fourth quarter 2019 and continuing up to the Offering date of July 28, 2020, we recorded significant increases in compensation expense associated with these programs due to the value of our common stock rising significantly as our proximity to an initial public offering became more likely. As the awards associated with these programs either converted to equity-based awards or were redeemed upon the occurrence of the Offering, compensation expense is no longer required to be recorded for the appreciation in value of our common stock at each measurement date. At the Offering date, there was $44.3 million in unrecognized compensation expense for unvested converted awards that will be recognized over the remaining service period of one to four years. In addition, in connection with the Offering, we granted equity awards to certain of our employees, consultants and directors with a fair value of approximately $15.1 million, of which $4.4 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense in 2020, with the balance being recorded over the requisite service period of one to four years. We expect that our stock-based compensation expense will be significantly higher relative to historical periods for the foreseeable future, and as a result, historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future results. Historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future performance. Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have calculated non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling and marketing expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow margin, which are each non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided tabular reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate financial performance and liquidity. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as supplemental disclosure as we believe they provide useful information to 47 investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results, prospects, and liquidity period-over-period without the impact of certain items that do not directly correlate to our operating performance and that may vary significantly from period to period for reasons unrelated to our operating performance, as well as comparing our financial results to those of other companies. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K We calculate these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 48 We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measures. Refer to “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Key Business Metrics ” for further discussion and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow margin to the related GAAP financial measures. The following schedules reflect all other non-GAAP financial measures and reconcile such non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures: ​ 49 ​ ​ 50 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $303.1 million and retained earnings of $21.9 million. Prior to July 31, 2020, our primary sources of capital had been from sales of our solutions and proceeds from bank lending facilities. On July 31, 2020, we received $423.0 million in proceeds, net of underwriting fees and commissions, from the sale of 23,812,216 shares of our Class A common stock and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the $175.0 million term loan facility. As a result, we have no outstanding bank debt after such redemption. The net proceeds remaining after payment of Offering costs are being used for working capital and other corporate purposes. We believe that our existing cash resources and our $100 million bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow from our banks. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms unacceptable to us . Historical Cash Flows Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: ​ Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $59.5 million in 2020 compared to $92.5 million in 2019, a decrease of $33.0 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to $22.9 million in cash payments for redemption of SARs converted to stock options in connection with the Offering where such cash flows are required under GAAP to be classified as operating consistent with the original SARs’ liability classification. The remaining decrease in operating cash flows of $10.1 million was a result of an increase in costs associated with increased development activity associated with nascent technologies and comparatively lower cash generated through changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenues as a result of timing, sales mix and differences in customer payment terms. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $44.4 million in 2020 compared to $37.6 million in 2019, an increase of $6.8 million. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Systax, partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in cash consumed to support on-premise capitalized software additions in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease in on-premise capitalized software development costs is associated with the continued shift in our development efforts to cloud-based solutions. Investments in cloud-based solutions increased by $4.5 million in 2020 over 2019 and are included in internal use software as additions to property and equipment. These increased investments in cloud-based solutions offset the reductions in investments in other property and equipment due to delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Financing Activities. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $213.6 million in 2020 compared to $(30.6) million in 2019, an increase of $244.2 million. This increase was primarily due to $423.0 million in net proceeds received from the Offering, partially offset by $117.6 million of increased distributions paid to stockholders prior to the Offering and a $45.7 million increase in net repayments of indebtedness. 51 Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: ​ Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $92.5 million in 2019 compared to $80.4 million in 2018, an increase of $12.1 million. This increase was primarily due to increased net income of $4.5 million, after adding back the 2018 asset impairment of $32.7 million, increases in stock-based compensation of $4.4 million and a net increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $3.6 million. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $37.6 million in 2019 compared to $33.3 million in 2018, an increase of $4.2 million. This increase is due to investments focused on productivity enhancement associated with process automation and implementation of new tools. Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $30.6 million in 2019 compared to $30.7 million in 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in principal repayments of bank debt of $2.3 million, offset by an increase in cash collected with respect to customer funds obligations of $2.6 million. Indebtedness On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a bank, which was subsequently amended on April 3, 2020 to permit another bank to be a party to the agreement, consisting of a $175.0 million term loan (the ""Term Loan"") and a $100.0 million committed line of credit (the ""Line of Credit"") (collectively, the ""Credit Agreement""). Net proceeds from the Term Loan after payment of financing fees of $2.9 million and repayment of the amounts outstanding under a previous credit agreement of $61.7 million were used to fund a portion of the $123.0 million distribution made to stockholders on May 29, 2020. As required by the terms of the Credit Agreement, we repaid the Term Loan principal with the net proceeds of the Offering. The Line of Credit matures in March 2025 and had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020. The Company has the option to select an applicable interest rate at either the bank base rate plus an applicable margin (the “Base Rate Option”) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin (the “LIBOR Option”). The applicable margins are determined by certain financial covenant performance as defined in the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2020 the Base Rate Option and LIBOR Option applicable to Line of Credit borrowings were 3.25% and 2.00%, respectively. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain assets of the Company and contains financial and operating covenants that we are in compliance with as of December 31, 2020. For more information on our indebtedness see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Funds Held for Customers and Customer Funds Obligations We maintain trust accounts with financial institutions, which allows our customers to outsource their tax remittance functions to us. We have legal ownership over the accounts utilized for this purpose. Funds held for customers represent cash and cash equivalents that, based upon our intent, are restricted solely for satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to our tax remittance services. Funds held for customers are not commingled with our operating funds. 52 Customer funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit collected funds to satisfy customer tax payments. Customer funds obligations are reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the obligations are expected to be settled within one year. Cash flows related to changes in customer funds obligations are presented as cash flows from financing activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 are summarized in the table below: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our consolidated financial statements cannot be determined with certainty, and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following sections. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and such estimates routinely require adjustment. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. Our discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement, not duplicate, our summary of significant accounting policies so that readers will have greater insight into the uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies and estimates. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 53 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for subscription and non-renewal cancellations and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Licenses for on-premise software subscriptions provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers purchase a subscription to these licenses, which includes the related software and tax content updates and product support. The updates and support, which are part of the subscription agreement, are essential to the continued utility of the software. Therefore, we have determined the software and the related updates and support to be a single performance obligation. Accordingly, when on-premise software is licensed, the revenue associated with this combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the license term as these subscription services are provided for the duration of the license term. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the software is made available to the customer to download. Our on-premise software subscription prices in the initial subscription year are higher than standard renewal prices. The excess initial year price over the renewal price (""new sale premium"") is considered to be a material right. We recognize revenue associated with the material right over the estimated period of benefit to the customer, generally three years. Cloud-based subscriptions allow customers to use Company-hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. The cloud-based offerings also include related updates and support. All services within the cloud-based contracts would consistently provide a benefit to the customer during the subscription period, thus the associated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the customer is provided access to the cloud-based services. Revenue from deliverable-based services is recognized as services are delivered. Revenue from fixed fee services is recognized as services are performed using the percentage of completion input method. We have elected the ""right to invoice"" practical expedient for revenue related to services that are billed on an hourly basis, which enables revenue to be recognized as the services are performed. We have determined that the methods applied to measuring our progress toward complete satisfaction of performance obligations recognized over time are a faithful depiction of our transfer of control of software and services to customers. Significant Judgments Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Identification of the amortization periods of material rights and contract costs requires significant judgement by management. Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing customers. A receivable, or contract asset, is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet when customers are billed related to revenue to be collected and recognized for subscription agreements as there is an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these subscriptions. A receivable and related revenue may also be recorded in advance of billings to the extent services have been performed and we have a right under the contract to bill and collect for such performance. Subscription-based customers are generally invoiced at the beginning of each annual subscription period. A contract liability is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet when subscription-based customers are billed in advance of performance obligations being satisfied, and revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing ratably over the subscription period or over the amortization period of material rights. Deferred sales commissions earned by our sales force and certain sales incentive programs and vendor referral agreements are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. An asset is recognized for these incremental contract costs and reflected as deferred commissions in the consolidated balance sheet. 54 These contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period consistent with the transfer of the associated product and services to the customer, which is generally three years. Amortization of these costs are included in selling and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We periodically review these contract assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these assets. There were no contract asset impairment losses recorded for the periods presented. Payment Terms Payment terms and conditions vary by contract, although our terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing products and services, not to receive financing from customers or to provide customers with financing. Stock-Based Compensation We apply the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, for the award of equity-based instruments. The provisions of ASC 718 require a company to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation as of the grant date of the award. Stock-based compensation expense reflects the cost of employee services received in exchange for the awards. SARs are accounted for as liabilities under ASC 718 and, as such, we recognize stock-based compensation expense by remeasuring the value of the SARs at the end of each reporting period and accruing the portion of the requisite service rendered at that date. Prior to July 2, 2020, the date management determined the Company was considered to have become a public entity, we measured SARs based on their intrinsic value which reflected the difference between the fair value of the former Class B common stock at the reporting date less the grant date fair value of the underlying shares as this was the value the SAR participant could derive from exercise of the SAR award. Prior to the Offering, the fair value of the Company’s common stock was determined periodically by the board of directors with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation firm. Upon becoming a public entity, and up to the effective date of the Offering, outstanding SARs were remeasured using the fair value-based method under ASC 718. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the impact of the resulting change in accounting policy. Stock-based compensation expense for new stock options issued under the 2020 Plan after the Offering is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or performance period associated with the award. Stock-based compensation expense for RSAs and RSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s underlying common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or performance period associated with the award. The ESPP permits participants to purchase Class A common stock through payroll deductions, up to a specified percentage of their eligible compensation or a lump sum contribution amount for the initial offering period (July 28 to November 30, 2020), subject to the plan’s maximum purchase provisions during the specified offering periods. The plan is a compensatory plan as it allows participants to purchase stock at a 15% discount from the lower of the fair value of the Class A common on the first or last day of the ESPP offering period (the “ESPP discount”). The ESPP is accounted for as an equity-classified award. Stock-based compensation expense for the ESPP is measured based on the fair value of the ESPP award at the start of the offering period. The fair value is comprised of the value of the ESPP discount and the value associated with the variability in the Class A common stock price during the offering period (the “Call/Put”), which is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective offering period. The Company has elected to recognize award forfeitures as they occur. 55 Common Stock Valuations Prior to the Offering, the fair value of the common stock underlying the SAR Awards was determined by the board of directors with assistance from management and an independent third-party valuation firm. The determination of value used the market and income approaches, with an adjustment for marketability discount pertinent to private company entities in arriving at the per share fair value (the “valuation methodology”). Under the market approach, the guideline public company method is used, which estimates the fair value of the Company based on market prices of stock of guideline public companies. The income approach involves projecting the future benefits of owning an asset and estimating the present value of those future benefits by discounting them based upon the time value of money and the investment risks associated with ownership. At the end of 2019, due to the consideration by the board of directors of pursuing the Offering, the valuation methodology began to consider the impact of such an event on the value of the Company’s common stock underlying the awards. As the Company approached the Offering effective date, this resulted in increases in the value of the SAR Awards which resulted in corresponding increases to compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 which exceeded historical results. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality and Quarterly Trends.” Following the closing of the Offering, the fair value per share of our common stock for purposes of determining stock-based compensation will be the closing price of our common stock as reported on the applicable grant date. Software Development Costs Internal-Use Software We follow ASC 350-40, Goodwill and Other, Internal-Use Software, to account for development costs incurred for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use. ASC 350-40 requires such costs to be capitalized once certain criteria are met. Capitalized internal-use software costs are primarily comprised of direct labor, related expenses and initial software licenses. ASC 350-40 includes specific guidance on costs not to be capitalized, such as overhead, general and administrative and training costs. Internal-use software includes software utilized for cloud-based services as well as software for internal systems and tools. Costs are capitalized once the project is defined, funding is committed and it is confirmed the software will be used for its intended purpose. Capitalization of these costs concludes once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Post-configuration training and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software available for its intended use is included in internal-use software developed in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets once available for its intended use. Depreciation expense for internal-use software utilized for cloud-based customer solutions and for software for internal systems and tools is included in cost of revenues, software subscriptions and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We review the carrying value of internal-use software, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such software may not be fully recoverable. Whenever such events or circumstances are present, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value, if any, is recorded. Software Developed for Sale The costs incurred for the development of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized in accordance with ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed , when technological feasibility has been established. Technological feasibility generally occurs when all planning, design, coding and testing activities are completed that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. The establishment of technological feasibility is an ongoing assessment of judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated future revenues, estimated economic life and changes in technology. Capitalized software includes direct labor and related expenses for software development for new products and enhancements to existing products and acquired software. Amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over periods between three to five years. Unamortized capitalized software development costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately. 56 Capitalized software costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and changes in software technologies at least annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. In the event of impairment, unamortized capitalized software costs are compared to the net realizable value of the related product and the carrying value of the related assets are written down to the net realizable value to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed such value. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from the related product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of such product, including the costs of providing related maintenance and customer support. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually at October 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. The Company has determined that its business comprises one reporting unit. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, in which case a quantitative impairment test is not required. As provided for by ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit are considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. Income taxes On July 27, 2020, the Company’s S-Corporation election (the “S Election”) was terminated by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the Offering. As a result, the Company will now be taxed at the corporate level as a C-Corporation for U.S federal and state income tax purposes. Prior to July 27, 2020, as the Company was taxed as an S-Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for most states, net income or loss was allocated to the stockholders and was included on their individual income tax returns. In certain states, the Company was taxed at the corporate level. Accordingly, the income tax provision or benefit was based on taxable income allocated to these states. In certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company was taxed at the corporate level. Similar to states, the income tax provision or benefit was based on taxable income sourced to these foreign jurisdictions. Certain foreign subsidiaries in which we own greater than 50% of the equity by measure of vote or value are treated as controlled foreign companies (“CFCs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and most states under the IRS foreign tax regulations. The income and loss from these entities is reported on the Company’s U.S. federal and some state income tax returns when the foreign earnings are repatriated or deemed to be repatriated to the U.S. In conjunction with the termination of the S Election, certain direct and indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that were previously treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and most states under the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) “check-the-box” regulations, “unchecked-the-box” to become regarded entities and as a result, became CFCs. Prior to these elections, the income and loss from these entities was reported on the Company’s U.S. federal and most state income tax returns in addition to being reported on a foreign jurisdiction tax return regardless of whether or not the earnings were repatriated. We record deferred income taxes using the liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been previously recognized in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes , on the basis of a two-step process whereby: (i) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The impact as a result of the application of ASC 740 is reflected in the 57 consolidated financial statements. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits or expense based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. JOBS Act As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include: We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Offering. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer, ” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. ​ 58","Vertex is a leading provider of enterprise tax technology solutions. The company’s vision is to accelerate global commerce, one transaction at a time. Companies with complex tax operations rely on Vertex to automate their end-to-end indirect tax processes. VI’s software, content and services address the increasing complexities of global commerce and compliance by reducing friction, enhancing transparency, and enabling greater confidence in meeting indirect tax obligations. As a result, our software is ubiquitous within our customers' business systems, touching nearly every line item of every transaction that an enterprise can conduct. The company has pioneered tax technology for over 40 years. Today, VI has over 4,000 customers, including over half of the Fortune 500, and provides its customers with tax support in over 130 countries. Today, the company’s software enables tax determination, compliance and reporting, tax data management and document management with powerful pre-built integrations to core business applications used by most companies, particularly those applications that have a significant impact on global commerce. VI’s software is fueled by over 300 million data-driven effective tax rules and supports indirect tax compliance in more than 19,000 jurisdictions worldwide.
VI derives the majority of its revenues from software subscriptions. These subscriptions include use of VI’s software and ongoing monthly content updates. VI’s software is offered on a subscription basis to its customers, regardless of their deployment preferences. On-premise subscriptions are typically sold through one-year contracts and cloud-based subscriptions are typically sold through one- to three-year contracts. VI bills almost all of its customers annually in advance of the subscription period.

VI generated revenues of $374.7 million, $321.5 million and $272.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company had a net income (loss) of $(78.9) million, $31.1 million and $(6.1) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $78.4 million, $67.9 million and $61.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
On July 28, 2020, the Company effected the Recapitalization, which included effecting the Stock Split, establishing the New Capital Structure and effecting the Share Exchange. The effect of the Stock Split and the Share Exchange are recognized retrospectively in the company’s consolidated financial statements. Historical earnings per share information for all periods presented prior to the Offering was retrospectively restated.
VI’s Registration Statement was declared effective on July 28, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the Company receiving $423.0 million in proceeds from the sale of 23,812,216 shares of Class A common stock at an Offering price of $19.00 per share, net of underwriting fees. After payment of Offering costs of $6.2 million, the Company used a portion of the proceeds to pay off $175.0 million in outstanding debt. The net proceeds remaining after these payments are being used for working capital and other corporate purposes.
The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $10.5 million in 2020 is primarily driven by an increase of $36.8 million in non-GAAP gross profit, partially offset by increases in various non-GAAP operating expense categories including $13.2 million in non-GAAP general and administrative expense, $10.0 million in non-GAAP research and development expense, and $3.5 million in non-GAAP selling and marketing expense. Growth in these operating expense categories is driven primarily by the company’s ongoing investment in research and development, sales and marketing teams and technology infrastructure to support current and future growth..
Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased in 2020 and 2019 by 20 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, in comparison to the immediately preceding period, primarily because operating expenses increased at a higher rate than our increase in revenue, driven by our previously noted investments to enable future growth.
Free cash flow decreased by $5.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by a net decrease of $10.1 million in cash provided by operating activities, after reflecting the addback of $22.9 million in cash consumed by the redemption of SARs converted to stock options and subsequently redeemed in the Offering (“Converted SARs”), which was partially offset by a year over year reduction in cash consumed by investments in on-premise capitalized software development of $5.4 million. This decrease in on-premise capitalized software development costs is associated with the continued shift in our development efforts to cloud-based solutions. Investments in cloud-based solutions increased by $4.5 million in 2020 over 2019 and are included in internal use software as additions to property and equipment. These increased investments in cloud-based solutions offset the reductions in investments in other property and equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flow from operating activities, excluding the impact of the Converted SARs, were unfavorably impacted during the 2020 period as a result of an increase in costs associated with increased development activity associated with nascent technologies, and comparatively lower cash generated through changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenues as a result of timing, sales mix and differences in customer payment terms. Cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by our expansion of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 of $10.5 million as previously discussed. Free cash flow margin decreased in 2020 by 390 basis points compared to 2019, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations noted above during a period of expansion of total revenues of $53.2 million.

"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" and elsewhere in this report. See “Forward-Looking Information” immediately preceding Part I. STRATEGY Autodesk makes software for people who make things. If you have ever driven a high-performance car, admired a towering skyscraper, used a smartphone, or watched a great film, chances are you have experienced what millions of Autodesk customers are doing with our software. We empower innovators to achieve the new possible - enabling them to discover first-in-kind solutions to complex design challenges, deliver tangible outcomes in record time, and make data-powered decisions for sustainable outcomes. Our strategy is to build enduring relationships with customers, delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make process. To drive execution of our strategy, we are focused on three strategic priorities: delivering on the promise of subscription, digitizing the company, and reimagining construction, manufacturing, and production. We equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools, services, and access they need for success today and tomorrow. At every step, we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining, collaborating, and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers, for society, and for the world. And because creativity can’t flourish in silos, we connect what matters - from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform. Autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. We have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago, the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. Product Evolution We offer subscriptions for individual products and Industry Collections, enterprise business arrangements (“EBAs”), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as “subscription plan”). Subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses. Our subscription plans currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. Our cloud offerings, for example, BIM 360, Shotgun, AutoCAD web app, and AutoCAD mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes. We believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services. Industry Collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of Autodesk solutions and services, simplifying the customers’ ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry. We discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in fiscal 2016. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings, maintenance-to-subscription (“M2S”) , while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans. Since launching the program, a substantial majority of maintenance plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings . We will be retiring maintenance plan offerings as of May 7, 2021 and will allow customers to convert their remaining maintenance seats to subscription plan offerings prior to this date. 37 To support our strategic priority of re-imagining AEC, we are strengthening the foundation of our AEC solutions with both organic and inorganic investments. In fiscal 2021, we acquired Spacemaker which uses cloud-based, artificial intelligence (AI), and generative design to help architects, urban designers, and real estate developers make faster and more informed early-stage design decisions which can help maximize the long-term sustainability and return from property investments. Other acquisitions in fiscal 2021 included solutions that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract and process data from project plans and specifications allowing general contractors, subcontractors, and owners to automate workflows such as submittals and project closeout, as well as a leading provider of post-processing and machine simulation solutions in manufacturing. As part of our strategy in manufacturing, we continue to attract both global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloud-based Fusion 360 technology enhancements. Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available. Global Reach We sell our products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels. Our indirect channels include value added resellers, direct market resellers, distributors, computer manufacturers, and other software developers. Our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts, our highly specialized solutions, and business transacted through our online Autodesk branded store. See Note 2, ""Revenue Recognition"" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. We anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online Autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. However, we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue. We employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies. In addition, we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products. One of our key strategies is to maintain an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. This approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. We offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. For example, we have established the Autodesk Forge developer program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3D printing. In addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period. This network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. Our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our solutions quickly and easily. We have a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications. Impact at Autodesk To help our customers imagine, design, and make a better world, our impact initiatives focus our efforts on the areas where we can have the greatest positive impact: products and support for our customers, catalyzing impact and innovation across industry, investing in our customers’ and employees’ access and ability to learn and develop relevant skills for in-demand roles, and leading by example with our 100% renewable, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and inclusive business practices. Through our products and services, we partner with customers to help them better understand and improve the environmental, energy, and materials performance of everything they make, help them make products, buildings, and entire 38 cities that foster healthy and resilient communities, and help them adapt, grow, and prosper alongside increasing levels of automation. The Autodesk Foundation (the “Foundation”), a privately funded 501(c)(3) charity organization established and solely funded by us, leads our philanthropic efforts. The purpose of the Foundation is twofold: to support employees to make a better world by matching employees’ volunteer time and/or donations to nonprofit organizations; and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact. On our behalf, the Foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations, social and environmental entrepreneurs, and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future. Additional information about our environmental, social, and governance program are available in our annual impact report on our website at www.autodesk.com. Assumptions Behind Our Strategy Our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions, including: making our technology available to mainstream markets; leveraging our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students; improving the performance and functionality of our products; and adequately protecting our intellectual property. If the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. For further discussion regarding these and related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition - Judgments with Multiple Performance Obligations. Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities. For our product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements, the functional nature of the promise, as well as the customers’ value expectations, led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation. There is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities, which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with third-party cloud service providers. Furthermore, customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities. For contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. 39 In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel to determine the SSP. Strategic Investments. Strategic investment debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value. We assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment. Strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance, and any other readily available market data. For any available-for-sale debt securities, if Autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that Autodesk will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, Autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors. The credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. Impairment will be assessed at the individual security level. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to “Interest and other expense, net” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For our quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including: the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Business Combinations. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets’ useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from sales, subscriptions and maintenance agreements, and acquired developed technologies; • the acquired company's trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our product portfolio; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and • discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. 40 Realizability of Long-Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget, shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and the results of past impairment reviews. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets. We assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred tax assets, including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits, and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered. The valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for or release of a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. As we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the Netherlands, Canada, California, Michigan and U.S. capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized. Each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our global deferred tax assets. Loss Contingencies . As described in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Part II, Item 8, Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition. 41 OVERVIEW OF FISCAL 2021 • Total net revenue was $3.79 billion during fiscal 2021, an increase of 16% compared to the prior fiscal year. • Recurring revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 97% for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, compared to 96% for the same period in the prior fiscal year. • Net revenue retention rate (“NR3”) was within the range of 100% and 110% as of January 31, 2021, and within the range of 110% and 120% as of January 31, 2020. • Deferred revenue was $3.36 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior fiscal year. • Remaining performance obligations (short-term and long-term deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue) (“RPO”) was $4.24 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year. • Current remaining performance obligations were $2.74 billion, an increase of 16% compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue Analysis During fiscal 2021, net revenue increased 16%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 26% increase in subscription revenue. The increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 53% decrease in maintenance revenue. Further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “Results of Operations.” We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the United States and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, “Tech Data”) and Ingram Micro Inc. (“Ingram Micro”). Total sales to Tech Data accounted for 37% of Autodesk’ total net revenue during fiscal 2021 and 35% of Autodesk’s total net revenue during both fiscal 2020 and 2019. During both fiscal 2021 and 2020, Ingram Micro accounted for 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue and during fiscal 2019, Ingram Micro accounted for 11% of Autodesk’s total net revenue. Our customers through Tech Data and Ingram Micro are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscriptions and services. Should any of our agreements with Tech Data or Ingram Micro be terminated for any reason, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through Tech Data or Ingram Micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue. Consequently, we believe our business is not substantially dependent on Tech Data or Ingram Micro. Recurring Revenue and Net Revenue Retention Rate In order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics, including recurring revenue and NR3. These metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items. We use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the “Glossary of Terms” for the definitions of these metrics in Part I, Item 1 Business. The following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019: ________________ (1) The acquisition of a business may cause variability in the comparison of recurring revenue in this table above and recurring revenue derived from the revenue reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. NR3 was within the range of 100% and 110% as of January 31, 2021, and within the range of 110% and 120% as of January 31, 2020. 42 Foreign Currency Analysis We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, Finland, and the United Kingdom. The following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend: ________________ (1) Please refer to the “Glossary of Terms” in Part I, Item 1 Business for the definitions of our constant currency growth rates. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend, and income (loss) from operations in future periods. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar. Remaining Performance Obligations RPO represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, license, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized. Unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2, “Revenue Recognition” for more details on Autodesk's performance obligations. RPO consisted of the following: We expect that the amount of RPO will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration, and size of customer subscription and support agreements, varying billing cycles of such agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Historically, we have had increased EBAs sale activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may effect the relative value of our fourth quarter billings and RPO. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items At January 31, 2021, we had $1,857.2 million in cash and marketable securities. Our cash flow from operations increased to $1,437.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, from $1,415.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $549.4 million during fiscal 2021. Comparatively, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $455.5 million during fiscal 2020. Further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 43 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Impacts of COVID-19 to Autodesk’s Business We are continuing to conduct business during the COVID-19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization, postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events, among other modifications. We have observed other companies, as well as many governments continuing to take precautionary measures to address COVID-19, and they may take further actions that alter their normal business operations. We continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. In the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2021, we experienced usage levels above pre-COVID-19 levels in most of Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. Usage rates in the United States and the United Kingdom remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Contributing to our revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2021, was record EBAs, strong subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales, and continued sequential growth in new business. In our target markets, both Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (“AEC”) and Manufacturing (“MFG”) experienced growth as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter in the prior year. We also took action to support our customers during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and extended payment terms to 60 days through August 7, 2020, offering free commercial use of our cloud collaboration products through June 2020, and delayed the transition from multi-user licenses to named-user licenses from May 2020 to August 2020 to minimize customer disruption. Further, we deferred a 20% maintenance price increase from May 2020 to August 2020 to give customers additional time to consider a subscription agreement. Given the evolving business environment as a result of COVID-19, we are actively managing our spending, reducing travel and entertainment expense, monitoring our hiring rate, and rationalizing our marketing spend. We will continue to invest in critical areas such as R&amp;D, construction, and digitizing the company to ensure our future success as we come out of the pandemic. We believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate the economic challenges of COVID-19. The extent of the impact on our business in fiscal 2022 and beyond will depend on several factors, including the full duration and the extent of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses, and consumers in response to the pandemic; speed and timing of economic recovery; our billings and renewal rates, including new business close rates, rate of multi-year contracts, pace of closing larger transactions, and new unit volume growth; and effect of the pandemic on margins and cash flow. All of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time, and some of these factors are not within our control. Further discussion of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Net Revenue by Income Statement Presentation Subscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible EBAs. Revenue from these arrangements is predominately recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. Under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreements, which is generally one year. Other revenue consists of revenue from consulting, training, and other products and services, and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed. 44 ____________________ (1) We expect maintenance revenue will continue to decline; however, the rate of decline will vary based on the number of renewals, the renewal rate, and our ability to incentivize maintenance plan customers to transition to subscription plan offerings. 45 Net Revenue by Product Family Our product offerings are focused in four primary product families: Architecture, Engineering and Construction (“AEC”), AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, Manufacturing (“MFG”), and Media and Entertainment (“M&amp;E”). 46 Net Revenue by Geographic Area ____________________ * Constant currency data not provided at this level. We believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue. Unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue, including in emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. Increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability in the global market may impact our future financial results. 47 Net Revenue by Sales Channel 48 Net Revenue by Product Type Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue includes the labor costs of providing product support to our subscription and maintenance customers, including SaaS vendor costs and allocated IT costs, facilities costs, professional services fees related to operating our network and cloud infrastructure, royalties, depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries, related expenses of network operations, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges. Cost of other revenue includes labor costs associated with product setup, costs of consulting and training services contracts, and collaborative project management services contracts. Cost of other revenue also includes stock-based compensation expense, overhead charges, allocated IT and facilities costs, professional services fees, and gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges. Cost of revenue, at least over the near term, is affected by labor costs, hosting costs for our cloud offerings, the volume and mix of product sales, fluctuations in consulting costs, amortization of developed technology, new customer support offerings, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, stock-based compensation expense, and gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges. Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees, the expense of travel, entertainment, and training for such personnel, sales and dealer commissions, and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs. Marketing and sales expenses also include SaaS vendor costs and allocated IT costs, payment processing fees, the cost of supplies and equipment, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, facilities costs, and labor costs associated with sales and order management. 49 Research and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for research and development employees, the expense of travel, entertainment, and training for such personnel, professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors, SaaS vendor costs and allocated IT costs, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, and facilities costs. General and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our CEO, finance, human resources, and legal employees, as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, SaaS vendor costs and net IT costs, certain foreign business taxes, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, expense of travel, entertainment, and training, facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, and the cost of supplies and equipment. 50 The following table highlights our expectation for the absolute dollar change and percent of revenue change for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021: 51 Interest and Other Expense, Net The following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense, net: Interest and other expense, net, increased by $34.2 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in impairments and negative measurement alternative adjustments on our strategic investment equity securities and a decrease in interest income offset by a decrease in interest expense as result of the payment in full of our term loan, and an increase in mark-to-market gains on marketable securities. Interest and other expense, net, increased by $30.5 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. This was primarily driven by losses in the current year versus gains in the previous year on our strategic investment equity securities, curtailment gains on our pension plans in the prior period, and an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on December 17, 2018, in aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million, which has been paid in full as of January 31, 2020. The increase in interest and other expense, net, was partially offset by mark-to-market gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year on marketable securities. Interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash, marketable securities and debt balances, average maturities, and interest rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of re-measuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. The amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year. Provision for Income Taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. Furthermore, on January 22, 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the TCJA. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company has elected to recognize any potential GILTI obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred. Income tax benefit was $661.5 million and expense was $80.3 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, relative to pre-tax income of $546.7 million and $294.8 million, respectively, for the same periods. The tax benefit for fiscal 2021 consists primarily of the U.S. valuation allowance release, U.S. foreign derived intangible income permanent benefit, share-based compensation deductions and generation of federal tax credits, offset by foreign tax expense, including withholding tax. Tax expense for fiscal 2020 consisted of foreign tax expense, including withholding tax, and U.S. tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles, offset by a tax benefit from the release of Singapore valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. The valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. 52 In fiscal 2016, we considered cumulative losses in the United States from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence. Considering this negative evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the U.S. deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Similarly, in fiscal 2018 we recorded a valuation allowance against our Singapore deferred tax assets due to significant negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses. Foreign operations in the Netherlands and Canada that generated interest expense and future creditable research in excess of earnings, respectively, also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the more likely than not realizability criteria. We released our Singapore valuation allowance in fiscal 2020 due to positive evidence in the form of cumulative earnings, resulting in a $42.0 million non-cash benefit to earnings. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the U.S., resulting in a $679.0 million non-cash benefit to earnings. We released the U.S. valuation allowance in fiscal 2021 due to the following positive evidence: • Recent history of worldwide pre-tax earnings, including cumulative earnings on a worldwide basis as of fiscal 2021 • Recent history of U.S. taxable income • Forecast of worldwide and U.S. pre-tax earnings, including a forecast of cumulative earnings in the U.S. jurisdiction • Forecast of U.S. taxable income • Reversal of deferred tax liabilities We have retained a valuation allowance against California deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets. As we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more likely than not that the Netherlands, Canada, California, Michigan, and capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized. As of January 31, 2021, we had $198.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $31.7 million would reduce our valuation allowance, if recognized. The remaining $166.3 million would impact the effective tax rate. It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months for an audit settlement of approximately $8.2 million. Our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws. A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. 53 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION In addition to our results determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) discussed above, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our gross profit, gross margin, income (loss) from operations, operating margin, net income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were as follows (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin, and per share data): For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons, we use non-GAAP measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. We also use non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits, credits, expenses, and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. For the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. This allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. We also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 54 RECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (In millions except for gross margin, operating margin, and per share data): 55 _______________ (1) Totals may not sum due to rounding. (2) CEO transition costs include stock-based compensation of $16.4 million related to the acceleration of eligible stock awards in conjunction with the Company's former CEOs' transition agreements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. (3) Fiscal year 2019 balances previously presented in ""Discrete tax provision items."" Our non-GAAP financial measures may exclude the following: Stock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses from non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies. Amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles. We incur amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods. CEO transition costs. We exclude amounts paid to the Company’s former CEOs upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements, including severance payments, acceleration of restricted stock units, and continued vesting of performance stock units, and legal fees incurred with the transition. Also excluded from our non-GAAP measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new CEO. These costs represent non-recurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses. We further believe that excluding the CEO transition costs from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability. Goodwill impairment. This is a non-cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Restructuring and other exit costs, net. These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. 56 Acquisition-related costs. We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including due diligence costs, professional fees in connection with an acquisition, certain financing costs, and certain integration-related expenses. These expenses are unpredictable, and dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our Company. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe excluding acquisition-related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company's historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. Loss (gain) on strategic investments and dispositions. We exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions of strategic investments, purchased intangibles, and businesses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results. Included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components, dividends received, realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments, and gain and loss on dispositions. We believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly. Discrete tax provision items. We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-GAAP measure of net income (loss), and include a non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate. Discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. Examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax law. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. We believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance. Establishment (release) of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets. This is a non-cash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, and restructuring charges and other exit costs (benefits) for GAAP and non-GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities, and overhead costs. Long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications At January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.86 billion and net accounts receivable of $643.1 million. Our marketable securities include $81.0 million of debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans. On February 23, 2021, we announced the pending acquisition of Storm UK Holdco Limited, the parent of Innovyze, Inc., for approximately $1.0 billion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in our first quarter of fiscal 2021. We intend to fund this acquisition with readily available cash. See Part II, Item 8, Note 17, “Subsequent Events,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On December 17, 2018, Autodesk entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million, with an option to request increases in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million. The maturity date on the line of credit facility is December 2023. At January 31, 2021, Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit. As of March 19, 2021, we have no amounts outstanding 57 under the credit facility. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, “Borrowing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants, we will not be able to draw on our credit facility. As of January 31, 2021, we have $1.65 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes payable outstanding. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, “Borrowing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup and its global affiliates. In addition, Citibank N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $650.0 million line of credit. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 59% of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. There are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions, or adverse tax costs. The TCJA included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the United States with little to no incremental U.S. taxes. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended contract payment terms for up to 60 days for all customers and partners for new orders and renewals placed directly with Autodesk. This payment terms extension program began on March 16, 2020, and ended on August 7, 2020. We currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic but we will continue to monitor the impact of potential disruptions beyond our control. Based on our current business plan, planned acquisitions, and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. See Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for further discussion. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.44 billion for fiscal 2021, primarily consisted of $1,208.2 million of our net income adjusted for $217.6 million non-cash items such as deferred income tax including the release of our deferred tax valuation allowance, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense. The increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to: a net increase in deferred revenue of $344.4 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and EBA offerings and a decrease in maintenance subscriptions; and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $129.6 million primarily due to the timing of payments for operating expenses and accruals for employee related costs. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.42 billion for fiscal 2020 consisted of $712.0 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities, $488.6 million of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, and our net income of $214.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $403.9 million for fiscal 2021 and was primarily due to business combinations, net of cash acquired, capital expenditures, purchases of strategic investments, and purchases of marketable securities. These cash outflows were partially offset by maturities of marketable securities. 58 At January 31, 2021, our short-term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of $85.0 million and a cost basis of $68.5 million. The portfolio fair value consisted of $81.0 million of short-term trading securities that were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our Deferred Compensation Plan (see Note 7, “Deferred Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Net cash used in investing activities was $57.3 million for fiscal 2020 and was primarily due to capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. These cash outflows were partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,046.8 million in fiscal 2021 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and repayment of debt. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $466.8 million in fiscal 2020 and was primarily due to repayment of debt and repurchases of our common stock and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance, net of discount and proceeds from issuance of common stock. 59 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2021, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. ____________________ (1) This table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax accruals for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Part II, Item 8, Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. 60 We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Autodesk’s stock repurchase program provides Autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. Under the share repurchase program, Autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price, and legal and regulatory requirements. During the three and 12 months ended January 31, 2021, we repurchased 0.5 million and 2.6 million shares of our common stock, respectively. At January 31, 2021, 12.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. This program does not have a fixed expiration date. See Part II, Item 8, Note 11, “Stock Repurchase Program,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of January 31, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 61","Autodesk makes software for people who make things. The company empowers innovators to achieve the new possible - enabling them to discover first-in-kind solutions to complex design challenges, deliver tangible outcomes in record time, and make data-powered decisions for sustainable outcomes. The company’s strategy is to build enduring relationships with customers, delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make process. To drive execution of the company's strategy, the company is focused on three strategic priorities: delivering on the promise of subscription, digitizing the company, and reimagining construction, manufacturing, and production. Autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. The company has developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer.

The company offers subscriptions for individual products and Industry Collections, enterprise business arrangements (“EBAs”), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as “subscription plan”). Subscription plans are designed to give its customers more flexibility with how they use the company’s offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses.

The company’s subscription plans currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. The company's cloud offerings, for example, BIM 360, Shotgun, AutoCAD web app, and AutoCAD mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes. The company believes that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services.

Industry Collections provide the company’s customers with access to a broader selection of Autodesk solutions and services, simplifying the customers’ ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry.

As part of the company’s strategy in manufacturing, it continues to attract both global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with the company's generative design and cloud-based Fusion 360 technology enhancements.

The company’s strategy includes improving its product functionality and expanding its product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which the company can deliver product functionality to its customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact the company’s operating margins. The company continually reviews these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. The company sells its products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels.

In addition to the competitive advantages afforded by the company’s technology, its large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period. This network of partners and relationships provides the company with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. The company's distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides the company's customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support the company's solutions quickly and easily. The company has a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with its solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications.

•Total net revenue was $3.79 billion during fiscal 2021, an increase of 16% compared to the prior fiscal year.

During fiscal 2021, net revenue increased 16%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 26% increase in subscription revenue. The increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 53% decrease in maintenance revenue.

The company relies significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the United States and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, “Tech Data”) and Ingram Micro Inc. (“Ingram Micro”). Total sales to Tech Data accounted for 37% of Autodesk’ total net revenue during fiscal 2021 and 35% of Autodesk’s total net revenue during both fiscal 2020 and 2019. During both fiscal 2021 and 2020, Ingram Micro accounted for 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue and during fiscal 2019, Ingram Micro accounted for 11% of Autodesk’s total net revenue.

The company generates a significant amount of the company's revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, Finland, and the United Kingdom.

At January 31, 2021, the company had $1,857.2 million in cash and marketable securities. The company’s cash flow from operations increased to $1,437.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, from $1,415.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The company repurchased 2.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $549.4 million during fiscal 2021. Comparatively, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of the company's common stock for $455.5 million during fiscal 2020.

On December 17, 2018, Autodesk entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million, with an option to request increases in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million. The maturity date on the line of credit facility is December 2023. At January 31, 2021, Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit. As of March 19, 2021, the company had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. If the company is unable to remain in compliance with the covenants, it will not be able to draw on its credit facility.

As of January 31, 2021, the company had $1.65 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes payable outstanding.

"You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a leading provider of cloud-based software that simplifies, digitizes, and automates complex back-office financial operations for SMBs. By transforming how SMBs manage their cash inflows and outflows, we create efficiencies and free our customers to run their businesses. Our vision is to become the leading one-stop solution that helps millions of businesses around the world manage their financial operations. Our purpose-built, artificial-intelligence (AI)-enabled financial software platform creates seamless connections between our customers, their suppliers, and their clients. Customers use our platform to generate and process invoices, streamline approvals, make and receive payments, reconcile their books, and manage their cash. We have built sophisticated integrations with popular accounting software solutions, banks, card issuers, and payment processors, enabling our customers to access these mission-critical services through a single connection. In essence, we sit at the center of an SMB’s accounts payable and accounts receivable operations. We efficiently reach SMBs through our proven direct and indirect go-to-market strategies. We acquire customers directly through digital marketing and inside sales, and indirectly through accounting firms and strategic partnerships. As of June 30, 2021, our partners included some of the most trusted brands in the financial services business, including 85 of the top 100 accounting firms and six of the top ten largest financial institutions in the U.S., including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo Bank and American Express. As we add customers and partners, we expect our network to continue to grow organically. On June 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of DivvyPay, Inc. (Divvy), a leading provider of cloud-based spend management application and smart corporate cards to SMBs in the U.S. for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 billion. Following the acquisition, Divvy became our wholly owned subsidiary. Our consolidated results of operations shown below for fiscal 2021 include the operating results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion about the acquisition of Divvy. We have grown rapidly and scaled our business operations in recent periods. Our total revenue and net losses during fiscal 2021, which include the results of Divvy from the acquisition date, were $238.3 million and $98.7 million, respectively. Our total revenue during fiscal 2020 and 2019 was $157.6 million and $108.4, respectively, and our net losses during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were $31.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Proposed Acquisition of Invoice2go On July 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Invoice2go, Inc. (Invoice2go), a Delaware corporation that provides mobile-first accounts receivable software that empowers SMBs and freelancers to grow their client base, manage invoicing and payments, and build their brand. Invoice2go has operations in the U.S. and in Australia, and serves a large global customer base of SMBs. Pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including customary purchase price adjustments, we will pay aggregate consideration of approximately $625.0 million in cash and stock in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of Invoice2go. Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Invoice2go will become our wholly owned subsidiary. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions such as (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by Invoice2go stockholders in accordance with Delaware law and (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Impact of COVID-19 The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently uncertain at the time of this report. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of 54 businesses, and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, it has significantly impacted the health and economic environment around the world. Many public and commercial establishments, including schools, restaurants, and shopping malls, have restricted their operations or closed due to restrictions imposed by the government. Our customers have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the shelter-in-place and other similar state and local orders, the closure of manufacturing sites and country borders, and the increase in unemployment. These conditions may continue to have negative implications on demand for goods, the supply chain, production of goods, and transportation. A negative impact on our customers may cause them to go out of business, request discounts, extension of payment terms, or cancel l ation of their subscription to our platform. Any of these actions may have a negative impact on our future results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition . Our business continues to operate despite the disruption of many business operations in the U.S. due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not experienced significant business disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic and there have been positive developments recently in the U.S. and in other countries in combating the COVID-19 pandemic because of vaccinations, we are unable to predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the pandemic, the actions that may be taken by government authorities across the U.S. or other countries, the efficacy of vaccinations, the impact to our customers, strategic partners, and suppliers, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Revenue Model We generate revenue by charging subscription and transaction fees, and by earning interest on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while their payment transactions are clearing. Our subscription revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to our customers. Our transaction revenue is comprised of transaction fees and interchange income on a fixed or variable rate per transaction. Transactions primarily include card payments, check issuance, ACH origination, cross-border payments, and creation of invoices. Much of our revenue comes from repeat transactions, which are an important contributor to our recurring revenue. We also generate revenue from interest earned on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while payment transactions are clearing. When we process payment transactions, the funds flow through our bank accounts and we have a balance of funds held for customers that is a function of the volume and the type of payments processed. Interest is earned from interest-bearing deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. We hold these funds from the day they are withdrawn from a payer’s account to the day the funds are credited to the receiver. This revenue can fluctuate depending on the amount of customer funds held, as well as our yield on customer funds invested, which is influenced by market interest rates and our investments. We are authorized to hold customer funds and process payments through our bank accounts because we are a licensed money transmitter in all required U.S. states. This allows us to provide advanced treasury services and protect our customers from potential fraud. Our Receivables Purchases and Servicing Model We market Divvy charge cards to potential spending businesses and issue business-purpose charge cards through our partnerships with card issuing banks. When a business applies for a Divvy card, we utilize proprietary risk management capabilities to confirm the identity of the business, and perform a credit underwriting process to determine if the business is eligible for a Divvy card pursuant to our credit policies. Once approved for a Divvy card, the business is provided a credit limit and can use the Divvy software to request virtual cards or physical cards. The majority of cards issued through our platform are by Cross River Bank, an FDIC-insured New Jersey state chartered bank and WEX Bank, an FDIC-insured Utah state chartered bank. Our partnerships with these banks allow us to benefit from the banks’ ability to issue cards under their membership with the Visa and Mastercard networks while leveraging their banking licenses to comply with various federal, state, and other laws. Under this arrangement, we must comply with the banks’ credit policies and underwriting procedures, and the banks maintain ultimate authority to decide whether to issue a card or approve a transaction. We are responsible for all fraud and unauthorized use of a card and generally are required to hold the bank harmless from such losses unless claims regarding fraud or unauthorized use are due to the sole gross negligence of the bank. 55 When a spending business completes a purchase transaction, the payment to the merchant is made by our bank partner that issued the card. Obligations incurred by the spending business in connection with their purchase transaction are reflected as receivables on the bank’s balance sheet. The bank then sells a 100% participation interest in the receivable to us. Pursuant to our agreements with the banks, we are obligated to purchase the participation interests in all of the receivables originated through our platform, and our obligation are secured by cash deposits. When we purchase the participation right in the receivable, the purchase price is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the receivable We act as the servicer on all receivables we purchase from our issuing bank partners and earn a servicing fee on loans we sell to our funding sources. We do not sell the servicing rights on any of the loans, allowing us to control the consumer experience end-to-end. In order to purchase the participation rights in the receivables, we maintain a variety of funding arrangements, including warehouse facilities and purchase arrangements with a diverse set of funding sources. We typically fund a substantial portion of these receivable purchases by borrowing under credit facilities with our finance partners, although we may also fund receivables purchases using corporate cash. Typically, we immediately sell a portion of the receivables interests we have purchased to our warehousing subsidiary which funds the purchases through loans provided by our financing partners, and we may sell a portion of our receivables to a third-party institution pursuant to a purchase arrangement. As of June 30, 2021, we had $155.0 million in committed credit facility capacity, with $77.5 million drawn, and this is shown on our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On average, our spending businesses pay their statement balances in approximately 20 days. We act as the servicer on all receivables we purchase from our issuing bank partners and earn a servicing fee and retain a beneficial interest derivative in the form of a deferred purchase price on loans we sell to our funding sources. Our Business Model We efficiently reach SMBs through our proven direct and indirect go-to-market strategies. We acquire customers directly through digital marketing and inside sales. We also acquire customers indirectly by partnering with leading companies that are trusted by our current and prospective customers, including accounting firms, financial institutions, and software companies. Our revenue is visible and predictable from our existing customers. For fiscal 2021, over 85% of our subscription and transaction revenue, which we also refer to as core revenue, came from customers who were acquired prior to the start of the fiscal year. We expand within our existing customer base by adding more users, increasing transactions per customer, launching additional products, and through pricing and packaging our services. We make it easy for SMBs to try our platform through our risk-free trial program. Should an SMB choose to become a customer after the trial period, it can take several months to adapt their financial operations to fully leverage our platform. Even with a transition period, however, we believe our customer retention is strong. Excluding those customers of our financial institution partners, approximately 85 % of customers as of June 30, 2020 were still customers as of June 30, 2021. Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate Net dollar-based retention rate is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and usage of our platform, as well as potential revenue for future periods. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate at the end of each fiscal year. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate by starting with the revenue billed to customers in the last quarter of the prior fiscal year (Prior Period Revenue). We then calculate the revenue billed to these same customers in the last quarter of the current fiscal year (Current Period Revenue), excluding interest earned on customer funds held in trust. Current Period Revenue includes any upsells and is net of contraction or attrition, but excludes revenue from new customers and excludes interest earned on customer funds held in trust. We then repeat the calculation of Prior Period Revenue and Current Period Revenue with respect to each of the preceding three quarters, and aggregate the four Prior Period Revenues (the Aggregate Prior Period Revenue) and the four Current Period Revenues (the Aggregate Current Period Revenue). Our net dollar-based retention rate equals the Aggregate Current Period Revenue divided by Aggregate Prior Period Revenue. Our net dollar-based retention rate was 124%, 121% and 110% during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These consecutive increases are primarily attributable to increases in the number of users, more transactions per customer, and selling additional products to those customers. 56 Customer Acquisition Efficiency Our efficient direct and indirect go-to-market strategy, combined with our recurring revenue model, results in our short payback period. We define “payback period” as the number of quarters it takes for the cumulative non-GAAP gross profit we earn from customers acquired during a given quarter to exceed our total sales and marketing spend in that same quarter. For customers acquired during fiscal 2020, the average payback period was approximately five quarters. Key Business Metrics We regularly review several metrics, including the metrics presented in the table below, to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly-titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts or investors. Number of Customers For the purposes of measuring our key business metrics, we define customers as entities that are either billed directly by us or for which we bill our strategic partners during a particular period. Customers who are using our services during a trial period are not counted as new customers during that period. If an organization has multiple entities billed separately for the use of our platform, each entity is counted as a customer. The number of customers in the table above represents the total number of customers at the end of each fiscal year. Total Payment Volume To grow revenue from customers we must deliver a product experience that helps them automate their back-office financial operations. The more they use the product and rely upon our features to automate their operations, the more transactions they process on our platform. This metric provides an important indication of the value of transactions that customers are completing on the platform and is an indicator of our ability to generate revenue from our customers. We define TPV as the value of customer transactions that we process on our platform during a particular period. Our calculation of TPV includes payments that are subsequently reversed. Such payments comprised approximately 1% of TPV during fiscal 2021. TPV does not include transactions made by spending businesses on our spend management platform. 57 Transactions Processed We define transactions processed as the number of customer payment and spend transactions initiated and processed through our platform during a particular period. Payment transactions include checks, ACH items, wire transfers and card payments. Transactions processed do not include transactions made by spending businesses on our spend management platform. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and transaction fees, and (2) interest on funds held for customers. Subscription fees are fixed monthly or annually and charged to our customers for the use of our platform to process transactions. Subscription fees are generally charged on a per user per period basis, normally monthly or annually. Transaction fees are fees collected for each transaction processed through our platform, on either a fixed or variable fee basis. Transaction fees primarily include processing of payments in the form of checks, ACH, cross-border payments, virtual cards, creation of invoices, and use of spend management application whereby we receive interchange income from merchants that accept Divvy cards. Our contracts with SMB and accounting firm customers are generally either monthly or annual contracts. We determine the transaction price for these contracts by estimating the total consideration to be received over the contract term from subscription and transaction fees. We recognize the transaction price as a single performance obligation based on the proportion of transactions processed to the total estimated transactions to be processed over the contract period. We enter into multi-year contracts with financial institutions which typically include fees for initial implementation services that are paid during the period the implementation services are provided as well as fees for subscription and transaction processing services, which are subject to guaranteed monthly minimum fees that are paid monthly over the contract term. These contracts enable the financial institutions to provide their customers with access to our online bill pay services through the financial institutions’ online platforms. Implementation services are required up-front to establish an infrastructure that allows the financial institutions’ online platforms to communicate with the Company’s online platform. A financial institution’s customers cannot access online bill pay services until implementation is complete. The fees we earn through these contracts vary based on the number of users and transactions to be processed. We have determined these contracts meet the variable consideration allocation exception and therefore we recognize the guaranteed monthly payments and any overages as revenue in the month they are earned. We recognize implementation fees based on the proportion of transactions processed to the total estimated transactions to be processed over the contract period. Interest on funds held for customers consists of the interest that we earn from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing. Interest is earned from interest-bearing deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities, until those payments are cleared and credited to the intended recipient. Cost of Revenue and Expenses Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses, for our customer success and payment operations teams, certain costs that are directly attributed to processing customers’ transactions (such as the cost of printing checks), postage for mailing checks, expenses for processing payments (ACH, check, and cross-border wires), direct and amortized costs for implementing and integrating our cloud-based platform into our strategic partners’ systems, costs for maintaining, optimizing, and securing our cloud payments infrastructure, amortization of capitalized internal-use developed software, amortization of developed technology, fees on the investment of customer funds, and allocation of overhead costs. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars, but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period, as we continue to invest in growing our business. Research and development – Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, incurred in developing new products or enhancing existing products, and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize such costs in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. 58 We expense a substantial portion of research and development expenses as incurred. We believe that delivering new functionality is critical to attract new customers and expand our relationship with existing customers. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers’ experience and satisfaction, and to attract new customers. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period as we expand our research and development team to develop new products and product enhancements. Sales and Marketing – Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, sales commissions, marketing program expenses, travel-related expenses and costs to market and promote our platform through advertisements, marketing events, partnership arrangements, direct customer acquisition, amortization of intangible assets, and allocated overhead costs. Sales commissions that are incremental to obtaining new customer contracts are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with new customers. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating awareness of our company, platform, and products, creating sales leads, and establishing and promoting our brand. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing efforts by driving our go-to-market strategies, building our brand awareness, and sponsoring additional marketing events; however, we will adjust our sales and marketing spend level as needed, as the spend may fluctuate from period to period, in response to changes in the economic environment. General and Administrative – General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, for finance, risk management, legal and compliance, human resources and information technology, costs incurred for external professional services, provision for credit losses, losses from fraud, and allocated overhead costs. We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as we explore various growth initiatives, which include incurring higher professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth in our business. As a result, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period. Other (expense) income, net – Other (expense) income, net consists primarily of the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs in connection with our issuance of the 2025 Notes, interest expense on our borrowings from credit agreements, loss on sale of card receivables, and loss on the revaluation of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities, partially offset by interest income on corporate funds invested in money market instruments and highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income marketable securities, and accretion of debt premium. (Benefit from) provision for income taxes – (Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of the income tax benefit from the change in deferred tax liability balance relating to the 2025 Notes and a partial release of valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Divvy. 59 Results of Operations The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands): 60 The following table presents the components of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented as a percentage of total revenue: (1) Includes the results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021. Comparison of Fiscal 2021 and 2020 Revenue The components of our revenue during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows (amounts in thousands): (1) Includes the results of Divvy from the acquisition date on June 1, 2021.

The decrease was due mainly to the d ecrease in the yield we earned from investing customer funds, partially offset by the increase in the balance of customer funds held while payment transactions clear. The average rate of return earned on customer funds held was 0.32 % during fiscal 202 1 , a decrease of 123 basis points from fiscal 20 20 . The decrease in yield was due mainly to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s action to cut the federal funds rate during calendar year 20 20 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . The decrease in the yield we earned was partially offset by the increase in the balance of customer funds held while payment transactions clear. The average daily balance of customer funds in transit increased to approximately $1.9 billion during fiscal 2021 from approximately $1.4 billion during fiscal 2020, an increase of 37%. Fund balances increased due to growth in TPV. Our TPV increased to approximately $140.3 billion during fiscal 2021 from approximately $96.5 billion during fiscal 2020, an increase of 45%.

The benefit from income taxes during fiscal 2019 pertains primarily to the income tax benefit that is reported on the consolidated statements of operations and is offset against the income tax on the unrealized gain on investments in available-for-sale securities that is shown on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP metrics to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view. We believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. 68 Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as gross profit and gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin to our gross profit and gross margin for the periods presented (amounts in thousands): Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash (if any) that is available, after purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs, for operational expenses and investment in our business. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. The following table presents a reconciliation of our free cash flow to net cash used in operating activities for the periods presented (in thousands): Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, our available-for-sale short-term investments of $655.3 million, and our available lines of credit. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market funds and investments in debt securities with original maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments are comprised primarily of available-for-sale investments in corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, and U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of more than three months. Our lines of credit are comprised of credit agreements that we assumed from the acquisition of Divvy, under which we have a total borrowing commitment of $155.0 million. We can draw funds from these lines of credit to the extent there is sufficient balance of eligible acquired card receivables that serve as collateral. On November 30, 2020, we issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 0% convertible senior notes (2025 Notes) due on December 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes, which are further described below, are senior, unsecured obligations, and will not accrue interest unless we determine that special interest obligations are deemed necessary. The 2025 Notes are convertible by the holders at their option during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2021 under certain 69 circumstances . If the note holders exercise their right to convert, our current intent is to settle such conversion through a combination settlement involving a repayment of the principal portion in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, available-for sale short-term investments, and funds available under our lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements to fund future operations or obligations, including the repayment of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes in the event that the 2025 Notes become convertible and the noteholders opt to exercise their right to convert. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may have terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Cash Flows Below is a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our primary source of cash provided by our operating activities is our revenue from subscription and transaction fees. Our subscription revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to our customers. Our transaction revenue is comprised of transaction fees on a fixed or variable rate per type of transaction. We also generate cash from the interest earned on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while payment transactions are clearing. Our primary uses of cash in our operating activities include payments for employee salary and related costs, payments to third parties to fulfill our payment transactions, payments to sales and marketing partners, and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided in operating activities increased to $4.6 million during fiscal 2021 from a net cash used of $4.4 million during fiscal 2020 due mainly to the increase in subscription and transaction fees revenue; partially offset by the in crease in payments for costs of services and operating expenses. In addition, the net increase was partially due to the timing of usage of funds to pay our corporate expenditures. Net cash used in operating activities increased to $4.4 million during fiscal 2020 from $3.9 million during fiscal 2019 due primarily to the increase in payments for our services and operating expenses, primarily employee salary and related costs due to the increase in headcount and administrative costs as we now operate as a public company; partially offset by the increase in subscription and transaction fees revenue. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Our cash proceeds from our investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the maturities and sale of corporate and customer fund available-for-sale investments. Our cash usage for our investing activities consists primarily of purchases of corporate and customer fund available-for-sale investments, payment for business acquisition, purchases of property and equipment, and capitalization of internal-use software. Additionally, the increase or decrease in our net cash from investing activities is impacted by the net change in acquired card receivable balances. 70 Net cash used in investing activities increased to $ 1.4 b illion during fiscal 202 1 from $ 249.5 million during fiscal 20 20 due primarily to the increase in purchases of corporate and customer fund short-term investments , payment made to acquire Divvy, increase in acquired card receivables, and increase in purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by the increase in proceeds from the maturities and sale of corporate and customer short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $249.5 million during fiscal 2020 from $96.1 million during fiscal 2019 due primarily to the increase in purchases of corporate and customer fund short-term investments and the increase in purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by the increase in proceeds from the maturities of corporate and customer fund short-term investments. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Our cash proceeds from our financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, exercises of stock options, and employee purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). In addition, our cash proceeds from our financing activities during fiscal 2020 included net proceeds from our IPO and follow-on offering. Our cash usage for our financing activities consists primarily of payments of costs related to the issuance of debt and common stock, and payments for the purchase of Capped Calls. Additionally, the increase or decrease in our net cash from financing activities is impacted by the change in customer fund deposits liability. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2021 from $863.1 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, increase in exercises of stock options, increase in employee purchases of common stock under our ESPP, and increase in customer funds liability; offset by the purchase of Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes and repayment of our line of credit borrowings. Additionally, our cash from financing activities during fiscal 2020 included the net proceeds from our IPO and follow-on offering. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $863.1 million during fiscal 2020 from $491.7 million during fiscal 2019 due primarily to the proceeds from our IPO and follow-on offering (net of underwriting discounts and other offering costs), increase in exercises of stock options, and proceeds from our line of credit borrowings; partially offset by a lower change in customer funds deposits liability . Additionally, our cash from financing activities during fiscal 2019 included proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock. 2025 Notes As of June 30, 2021, we had outstanding 2025 Notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion. The 2025 Notes are convertible on or after September 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date on December 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes are convertible by the holders at their option during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2021 under certain circumstances, including if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the $160.88 per share initial conversion price. If the note holders exercise their right to convert, our current intent is to settle such conversion through a combination settlement involving a repayment of the principal portion in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $160.88 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $218.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments; provided that such cap price shall not be reduced to an amount less than the strike price of $160.88 per share. The purpose of the Capped Calls is to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes and/or offset any cash payments that we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. Credit Agreements The credit agreements that we assumed from Divvy consisted of (i) Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (2021 Revolving Credit Agreement) and (ii) Warehouse Credit Agreement (2019 Credit Agreement, as amended). The 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement has a total commitment of $95.0 million consisting of a Class A facility amounting to $75.0 million and a Class B facility amounting to $20.0 million. The total outstanding borrowings from the 71 Class A and Class B facilities, which bear interest at 2.75% and 10.25% per annum, respectively, plus LIBOR (subject to a floor rate of 0.25%) , were $37.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2021. The 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement matures in June 2023 or earlier pursuant to such agreement and the outstanding borrowings are payable on or before the maturity date. The 2019 Credit Agreement (as amended) has a total commitment of $60.0 million. The outstanding borrowings from the amended 2019 Credit Agreement, which bear interest at 6.0% per annum plus LIBOR (subject to a floor rate of 2.0%), amounted to $30.0 million as of June 30, 2021. The interest rate drops to 4.5% per annum plus LIBOR (subject to a floor rate of 0.25%) beginning October 2021. The 2019 amended Credit Agreement matures in January 2023 and the outstanding borrowings are payable on or before the maturity date. The available funds under our credit agreements, after deducting our borrowings totaling $77.5 million, was $77.5 million as of June 30, 2021. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Our principal commitments to settle our contractual obligations are as follows as of June 30, 2021 (in thousands): Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are contractually obligated to purchase all card receivables from U.S. based card issuing banks (Issuing Banks) including authorized transactions that have not cleared. The transactions that have been authorized but not cleared totaled $30.3 million as of June 30, 2021 and have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We have off-balance sheet credit exposures with these authorized but not cleared transactions; however, our expected credit losses with respect to these transactions was not significant as of June 30, 2021. Other than our expected credit loss exposure on the card transactions that have not cleared, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources as of June 30, 2021. 72 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Revenue recognition Our contracts with our customers require us to provide multiple services comprising subscription, transaction and implementation services. We identify performance obligations in these contracts by evaluating whether individual services are distinct. Services that are not distinct are combined into a single performance obligation. The evaluation of whether a service is distinct involves judgment and could impact the timing of revenue recognition. We determine the transaction price in these contracts based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to, which are typically variable. The transaction price is then allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Each performance obligation is analyzed to determine if it is satisfied over time or at a point in time. Our performance obligations are generally recognized as revenue over the period each performance obligation is satisfied using an attribution method that best reflects the measure of progress in satisfying the performance obligation. The attribution method used involves judgment and impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Our implementation services included in certain contracts with our financial institution customers consist of the development of interfaces between our online platform and the financial institutions’ on line platform. The financial institution’s customers cannot access online bill pay services until implementation is complete. As a result, initial implementation services are not capable of being distinct from subscription and transaction processing services, and are combined into a single performance obligation. We also evaluate the ability of financial institution customers to renew contracts without having to pay up-front implementation fees again to determine if it provides them a material right. Material rights, which have not been significant to date, are treated as separate performance obligations and are recognized over the expected period of benefit. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Business Combinations We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires assigning the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including liabilities assumed in the acquiree at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available. Convertible Senior Notes The Company accounts for its convertible senior notes (Notes) by separating the principal amount into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, which represents the conversion option, is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of 73 the Notes as a whole. The difference between the principal amount of the Notes and the liability component is initially recorded as a debt discount and is amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. The equity component of the Notes, which is included in additional paid-in capital, will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The debt issuance costs are allocated between the liability and equity components based on the respective values of the liability and equity components. The debt issuance costs allocated to the liability component are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method. The debt issuance costs allocated to the equity component are presented as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, by evaluating whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Company determines the classification of the lease, whether operating or financing, at the lease commencement date, which is the date the leased assets are made available for use. The Company uses the non-cancelable lease term when recognizing the right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, unless it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Modifications are assessed to determine whether incremental differences result in new contract terms and accounted for as a new lease or whether the additional right of use should be included in the original lease and continue to be accounted with the remaining ROU asset. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives. Variable costs, such as common area maintenance costs, are not included in the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities, but are expensed as incurred. As the implicit rate of the leases is not determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of the lease payments. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not recognize ROU assets on lease arrangements with a term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for such arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Credit Losses on Acquired Card Receivables We acquire card receivables pursuant to our contracts with certain Issuing Banks. The acquired card receivables portfolio consists of a large group of smaller balances from spending businesses across a wide range of industries. We establish an allowance for credit losses based on an estimate of uncollectible balances resulting from credit losses and such allowance could fluctuate depending on certain factors. An estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is performed by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date. In estimating expected credit losses, we use models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the attributes used to segment the portfolio, the determination of the historical loss experience look-back period, and the weighting of historical loss experience by monthly cohort. We use these models and assumptions to determine the reserve rates applicable to the outstanding acquired card receivable balances to estimate reserves for expected credit losses. Based on historical loss experience, the probability of default decreases over time, therefore the attribute used to segment the portfolio is the length of time since an account’s credit limit origination. Our models use past loss experience to estimate the probability of default and exposure at default by aged balances. We also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans based on historical recovery experience. Additionally, we evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, changes in underwriting strategies, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and the volume and severity of past due accounts. We review our assumptions periodically and the amount of allowance that we recorded may be impacted by actual performance of the acquired card receivables and changes in any of the assumptions used. In general, we write-off card receivables after the entire balance becomes 120 days delinquent. 74 Customer Rewards We offer a promotion program whereby users of our spend management application can earn rewards based on the volume of their card transactions. Users can redeem those rewards for cash, travel, and gift cards, among other things. We establish a rewards liability that represents management’s estimate of the cost for earned rewards. Our estimate of the liability is determined based on points earned for every card spend, an estimate of the redemption cost and an estimate of expected redemption (net of breakage). Our estimated liability could fluctuate based on the changes on the input used to make our estimate. Stock-based compensation Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the compensation costs for stock option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the option vesting term of four years, reduced for estimated forfeitures at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on the historical experience for annual grant years where the majority of the vesting terms have been satisfied. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which determine the fair value of the stock option awards. These assumptions include: Expected term – The expected term represents the period that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term for stock option awards is determined using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock-based awards. Expected volatility – The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of our common stock. T he expected volatility that we used for stock option awards assumed in an acquisition was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the lifecycle or area of specialty. Risk-free interest rate – The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of stock option awards for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. Expected dividend yield – We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock.

The company generates revenue by charging subscription and transaction fees, and by earning interest on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while their payment transactions are clearing.
The company’s subscription revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to the company’s  customers. The company’s transaction revenue is comprised of transaction fees and interchange income on a fixed or variable rate per transaction. Transactions primarily include card payments, check issuance, ACH origination, cross-border payments, and creation of invoices. Much of the company’s revenue comes from repeat transactions, which are an important contributor to the company’s recurring revenue.
The company regularly review several metrics, including the metrics presented in the table below, to measure the company’s performance, identify trends affecting the company’s business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The company believes that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing the company’s historical and future operating performance.

Results of operations:
Subscription and transaction fees increased to $232.3 million during fiscal 2021 from $136.4 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $95.9 million or 70%.
 	•	Subscription fees increased to $111.6 million during fiscal 2021 from $83.8 million during for fiscal 2020, an increase of $27.8 million or 33%, driven primarily by the increase in customers and average subscription revenue per customer;

 	•	Transaction fees increased to $120.7 million during fiscal 2021 from $52.6 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $68.1 million or 129% due mainly to increased adoption of new product offerings, the mix of transaction revenues shifting to variable-priced products, and Divvy’s transaction revenue from the acquisition date; and

Cost of revenue increased to $61.8 million during fiscal 2021 from $39.1 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $22.7 million or 58%. The increase was due mainly to the following:
 	•	a $9.2 million increase in direct costs associated with the processing of the company’s customers’ payment transactions, use of software applications and equipment, bank fees for funds held for customers, and data hosting services, which were driven by the increase in the number of customers, increased adoption of new product offerings, and an increase in the volume of transactions;

 	•	a $7.5 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of increased deferred service costs, due to the hiring of additional personnel who were directly engaged in providing implementation and support services to the company’s customers. The company’s  average headcount of such personnel during fiscal 2021 increased by 39% compared to fiscal 2020 or 33% excluding Divvy’s headcount;

 	•	a $3.3 million increase in costs for consultants, temporary contractors, and shared overhead and other costs; and

 	•	a $2.7 million increase in amortization of acquired developed technology.
Gross margin decreased to 74% during fiscal 2021 from 75% during fiscal 2020, a decrease of 1% due primarily to the amortization of acquired developed technologies.
Sales and marketing expenses increased to $71.4 million during fiscal 2021 from $45.4 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $26.0 million or 57%. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased to 30% during fiscal 2021 from 29% during fiscal 2020, due mainly to the non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets.

As of June 30, 2021, the company’s principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, available-for-sale short-term investments of $655.3 million, and available lines of credit. On November 30, 2020, the company issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes (2025 Notes) due on December 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations, and will not accrue interest unless the company determines that special interest obligations are deemed necessary. The 2025 Notes are convertible by the holders at their option during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2021 under certain circumstances.
The company’s primary source of cash provided by operating activities is revenue from subscription and transaction fees. The company also generates cash from the interest earned on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while payment transactions are clearing. The company’s primary uses of cash in operating activities include payments for employee salary and related costs, payments to third parties to fulfill payment transactions, payments to sales and marketing partners, and other general corporate expenditures.
Net cash provided in operating activities increased to $4.6 million during fiscal 2021 from a net cash used of $4.4 million during fiscal 2020 due mainly to the increase in subscription and transaction fees revenue; partially offset by the increase in payments for costs of services and operating expenses. In addition, the net increase was partially due to the timing of usage of funds to pay its corporate expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $1.4 billion during fiscal 2021 from $249.5 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the increase in purchases of corporate and customer fund short-term investments, payment made to acquire Divvy, increase in acquired card receivables, and increase in purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by the increase in proceeds from the maturities and sale of corporate and customer short-term investments. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2021 from $863.1 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, increase in exercises of stock options, increase in employee purchases of common stock under the company’s ESPP, and increase in customer funds liability; offset by the purchase of Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes and repayment of its line of credit borrowings. Additionally, the company’s cash from financing activities during fiscal 2020 included the net proceeds from the company’s IPO and follow-on offering.

OVERVIEW Ebix endeavors to provide on-demand software and e-commerce services to the insurance, financial, healthcare and e-learning industries. In the Insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy globally a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also providing SaaS enterprise solutions in the area of CRM, front-end &amp; back-end systems, outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The P&amp;C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. With a ""Phygital” strategy that combines over 320,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many (“ASEAN”) countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, Forex, travel, pre-paid &amp; gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management etc., in India and other markets. The Company’s Forex Exchange has the leading market share within India’s airport foreign exchange business and encompasses 20 international airports, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata International airports, all of which combined conducting over $4.8 billion in gross transaction value annually (pre-COVID-19). EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India conducts gross annual remittance of approximately $5 billion annually (pre-COVID-19) and is the clear market leader. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches and over 9,800 corporate clients, combined processing an estimated $2.5 billion in gross merchandise value per annum (pre-COVID-19). Through its various SaaS-based software platforms, Ebix employs thousands of domain-specific technology professionals to provide products, support and consultancy to thousands of customers on six continents. Ebix provides application software products for the insurance industry, including carrier systems, agency systems and exchanges, as well as custom software development. Approximately 88% of the Company’s revenues are either recurring or repeating (transaction-based) in nature. Rather than license our products in perpetuity, we typically either license them for multiple years with ongoing support revenues or license them on a limited term basis using a subscription hosting or Application Service Provider (""ASP"") model. Combined subscription-based and transaction-based revenues of $552 million comprised 88% of the Company's total revenues in 2020, as compared to 84% of total revenues in 2019. In 2020, subscription-based revenues decreased by approximately $14 million to $164 million, and as a percentage of the Company's total revenues was 26% in 2020 versus 31% in 2019. The Company has modified the classification of certain revenues in 2020, which impacts the presentation of 2019 revenues and percentages above versus the 2019 10-K presentation. The Company’s technology vision is to converge processes in a manner such that data can seamlessly flow between entities after an initial data entry has been made. Our customers include many of the top insurance and financial sector companies in the world. The insurance and financial markets continue to focus on initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate improvements in efficiency, both on the back end of transactions as well as at the consumer-involved front end of transaction processes. This drive for efficiency involves all entities and directly impacts the manner in which insurance and financial products are distributed. Management believes that both the insurance and financial services industries will continue to 36 experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly the norm across the world insurance and financial markets. Trends and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported and has spread globally, including to every state in the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. government declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments implemented travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions, in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions or orders, or the perception that such restrictions or orders could be implemented, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, and the cancellation or postponement of events. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We have not experienced a material impact from shifting our employees to a remote work environment, which we primarily attribute to the professionalism of our workforce and our extensive use of technology throughout our business. However, COVID-19 could negatively impact the productivity of our workforce if the pandemic requires prolonged remote working conditions. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, particularly beginning in March, we experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our solutions and services, particularly those related to the Company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and consulting business areas, after certain government restrictions were implemented. This decreased demand continued throughout 2020 in varying degrees for each business area, and even persists through the date of this filing for all of the above mentioned business areas, but most notably in the travel and foreign exchange businesses. We expect that demand variability for our products and services will continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cannot predict with any certainty when demand for these solutions/services will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Along with the measures mentioned above to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have also taken steps to strengthen our financial position to mitigate the adverse impact that COVID-19 has had or may have on our business and operations, including amending our Credit Facility, reducing salaries for certain employees, furloughing employees in the most negatively impacted business areas, eliminating certain employee positions, and eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures. Additionally, we have taken steps to preserve cash balances, including a temporary cessation to our share repurchase program. Our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not be reflective of current market conditions, or of our results for any future periods, which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent than the reported period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete description of the material risks that the Company currently faces. Key Performance Indicators Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor the Company's operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, and cash provided by operating activities. We monitor these indicators, in conjunction with our corporate governance practices, to ensure efficient management of our business and maintenance of effective controls. The MD&amp;A discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K, but can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020. The key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows: 37 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 Operating Revenue The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to products or services delivered over our exchanges or from our ASP, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects, including fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and travel services from our financial exchanges. Ebix’s revenue streams come from three product/service channels. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenues for each of those product/service channels for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 38 In the table above for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 there are $13.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of Insurance Exchange revenues derived in India that are being reported within the EbixCash Exchange channel above. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 8%, to $625.6 million compared to $580.6 million in 2019. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Across the U.S. and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. Countries across the world are re-opening economies, but are doing so in phases that differ in each country and, in many cases, within individual countries. While our travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses continue to be materially negatively impacted by COVID-19, the increase in 2020 total revenue year-over-year was due primarily to strong demand for the Company's payment solutions offerings in India (primarily prepaid gift cards), which increased by more than $200 million year-over-year to approximately $256 million, or 590% year-over-year growth. The increased demand for prepaid gift cards in India was primarily due to: (i) changes in regulations by the Reserve Bank of India related to debit cards, which has shifted demand in the market towards prepaid gift cards; (ii) COVID-19, which has facilitated increased online and electronic commerce due to restrictive lockdowns in 2020; and (iii) the Company's increased marketing efforts around the prepaid gift card business. The Company’s travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses had a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150 million, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, which offset the growth in the payments solutions business. The impact from fluctuations of the exchange rates for the foreign currencies in the countries in which we conduct operations also adversely affected reported revenue. During each of the years 2020 and 2019 the change in foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported consolidated operating revenue by $(21.9) million and $(9.3) million, respectively. Thus, on a constant currency basis total revenue for the fiscal year 2020 increased approximately 12% year-over-year. The specific components of our revenue based on our three main business lines and the changes experienced during the past year are discussed immediately below. Overall Exchange revenues increased $56.4 million, or 11%, as explained below: • Insurance Exchange division revenues decreased by $12.0 million, or 6%, principally due to challenges faced in our health content services channel, and the negative effect of foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening U.S. dollar • EbixCash Exchange division revenues increased $68.3 million, or 21%, due to a mix of organic growth and business acquisitions in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors, offset by foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening of the US Dollar. • Risk Compliance Solutions division revenues decreased by $11.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to a decline in our U.S. professional consulting services associated with some major realignments in the sector. International revenue accounted for 73% and 69% of the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Costs of Services Provided 39 Costs of services provided, which includes costs associated with product sales, customer support, consulting, implementation, and training services increased $138.1 million, or 67%, from $205.2 million in 2019 to $343.3 million in 2020 and the Company's gross margin decreased to 45.1% in 2020 from 64.7% in 2019. The increase in costs of services provided and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 is directly related to the increase in over $200 million in revenue within the Company’s payment solutions business (primarily gift card revenue) in fiscal years 2020 versus 2019. Payment solutions gross margins are significantly lower than other solutions and services the Company provides its customers. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the payment solutions gross margins for the Company were approximately 1% and 9.5%, respectively. Excluding the payment solutions business, gross margins for the Company in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were approximately 76% and 68%, respectively. The increase in gross margins, excluding the payment solutions business, in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 was driven by the revenue mix differences for the Company, with the Company’s highest margin solutions/services (e.g. insurance exchange software and services) experiencing less relative negative impact from COVID-19 during 2020 versus other solutions/services (e.g. travel, foreign exchange and remittance businesses). Product Development Expenses The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the development of new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the development of new data exchanges for use in domestic and international insurance markets, as well as the Forex and travel sectors. Product development expenses decreased $10.0 million, or 22%, from $45.3 million in 2019 to $35.3 million in 2020. The decrease is due to reduced personnel costs and is directly related to actions taken by management to reduce overall corporate expenditures in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 in response to COVID-19. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.7 million, or 29%, from $19.6 million in 2019 to $13.8 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily due to reduced advertising and marketing costs in response to COVID-19. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative (""G&amp;A"") expenses decreased $52.9 million, or 38%, from $140.4 million in 2019 to $87.5 million in 2020. This decrease was driven mostly by management’s strategic response to COVID-19 to reduce overall corporate costs, as well as material rent reductions and abatements as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, personnel-related costs decreased approximately $28 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019, and rent expense in fiscal year 2020 was approximately $23 million less than in fiscal year 2019. Other items impacting the year-to-year comparison of G&amp;A expenses include a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the $12.1 million accounts receivable reserve that was recognized in the third quarter of 2019 as a precautionary measure in regards to receivables that are due from a public sector entity in India and that were billed during the 2016 through 2019 operating periods. Additionally, in 2019 the Company reduced the acquisition earn out accrual for the ItzCash acquisition by $15.4 million, which served to decrease overall G&amp;A expenses in 2019. The one-time accounts receivable reserve of $12.1 million (increased G&amp;A expense) and the $15.4 million earn out accrual reduction (reduced G&amp;A expense) largely offset the impacts to overall G&amp;A expense in fiscal year 2019. Amortization and Depreciation Expenses Amortization and depreciation expenses decreased $730 thousand, or 5%, to $13.7 million in 2020 from $14.5 million in 2019 primarily due to lower amortization in 2020 versus 2019 related to definite lived intangibles resulting from prior acquisition activity, primarily in India. Interest Income Interest income decreased $462 thousand, or 73%, from $629 thousand in 2019 to $167 thousand in 2020 primarily due to decreases in the comparative balances in interest bearing accounts and overall lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019. 40 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $10.8 million, or 25% from $42.3 million in 2019 to $31.6 million in 2020, primarily due to decrease LIBOR interest rates in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, The Company’s working capital facilities in India had average balances that were approximately $30 million lower in 2020 versus 2019. These working capital facilities generally carry interest rates of between 6.75% and 9.45%. The decrease in working capital facilities was associated with both COVID-19's impact on operations and renegotiated customer agreements that improved the Company’s payment terms in 2020 relative to 2019. Foreign Exchange Loss Net foreign exchange loss of $387 thousand in 2020 which consisted of net losses realized and unrealized upon the settlement of receivables or payables and re-measurement of cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument. In fiscal year 2019, a net foreign currency exchange loss of $2.4 million was recorded. Income Taxes The Company recognized income tax expense of $5.3 million in 2020 compared to $0.2 million of income tax expense in 2019, representing an increase of $5.1 million. Our effective tax rate increased to 5.7% in 2020, compared with 0.2% in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 is due to a decrease in the availability of tax credits in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as a lower tax holiday benefit available in 2020 compared to 2019 and a lower benefit from state tax deductions. The pre-tax income from and the applicable statutory tax rates in each jurisdiction in which the Company had operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 are as follows: LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents on hand. We intend to continue to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities, in combination with the possible issuance of additional debt or equity, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic business acquisitions, to retire outstanding indebtedness, and to repurchase shares of our common stock if and as market and operating conditions warrant. 41 We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash balances and access to credit and the capital markets, if required, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the general market conditions for credit and equity securities is subject to substantial uncertainty. In the event additional liquidity needs arise, we may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. However, there are no assurances that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the covenants in our Credit Facility could adversely affect our ability to obtain such financing and our ability to make strategic acquisitions, fund investments, repurchase shares of our common stock or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest. We regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements, including the need for additional debt or equity offerings, when considering potential business acquisitions, or the development of new products or services. During fiscal year 2021, the Company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources to fund organic growth initiatives, strategic business acquisitions, and new product development initiatives and service offerings. Our cash and cash equivalents were $105.0 million and $73.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions. The free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions. Furthermore, the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the U.S. parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts. The approximate cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments balances held in our domestic U.S. operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of April 19, 2021 is presented in the table below (figures denominated in thousands): Our current ratio increased from 1.55 at December 31, 2019 to 1.89 at December 31, 2020, and our working capital position increased to $170.5 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $129.0 million at the end of 2019. The increase in our short-term liquidity position is primarily due to the following factors: (a) an approximately $91 million reduction in cash used for acquisitions in 2020 as compared to 2019; (b) a decrease in trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable from service providers at December 31, 2020 versus December 31, 2019 of approximately $24 million; and (c) partially offset by an approximately $44 million decrease in current liabilities during 2020, an increase in short-term investments of approximately $21 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, and a decrease in the Company's working capital facilities at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 of approximately $12 million. We believe that our ability to generate sustainable robust cash flow from operations will enable the Company to continue to meet its debt obligations and to fund its current liabilities from current assets, including available cash balances. Business Combinations 42 The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions in combination with organic growth initiatives as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. The Company looks to acquire businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services. During the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, the Company completed two business acquisition as follows: Effective May 4, 2020, Ebix acquired from bankruptcy India-based Trimax, which provides IT and integration services to state-owned transport corporations, operates data centers, and is an IT infrastructure solution provider, for approximately $9.9 million of upfront consideration. Additionally, Ebix issued preferred shares in Trimax to the selling shareholders that can be sold five years from the closing of the acquisition based on an independent valuation performed by a Big 4 valuation firm. The maximum value of the preferred shares upon sale is approximately $9.9 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction. In October 1, 2020 the Company acquired a 70% interest in AssureEdge Global Services (“AssureEdge”) for a total purchase price of approximately $5.0 million, including net working capital acquired. AssureEdge is a pan-India based BPO company, with a variety of BPO offerings via six contact centers across the country. It serves a number of industries and clients that have cross-selling value for EbixCash services. The valuation and purchase price allocation remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable, but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed three business acquisitions, as follows: Effective August 23, 2019, Ebix acquired Canada based Wallstreet Canada foreign exchange and outward remittance markets for approximately $2.1 million of upfront consideration plus net working capital. Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired the assets of India based Essel Forex, for approximately $8.7 million, plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $721 thousand based on earned revenues. Ebix funded the entire transaction in cash, using its internal cash reserves. Essel Forex is a large provider of foreign exchange services in India with a wide spectrum of related products including sales of all major currencies, travelers’ checks, demand drafts, remittances, money transfers and prepaid cards primarily for corporate clients. The earn-out period expired on December 31, 2019 and the acquired business did not meet the requisite revenue target, so no earnout payment was due or paid. Effective January 1, 2019, Ebix acquired an 80% controlling stake in India based Zillious for $10.1 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.2 million based on agreed milestones in the acquisition agreement. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. Zillious is an on-demand SaaS travel technology solution in the corporate travel segment in India. The Company determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was zero as of September 30, 2020 and at December 31, 2020. A significant component of the purchase price consideration for many of the Company's business acquisitions is a potential subsequent cash earn-out payment based on reaching certain specified future revenue targets. The terms for the contingent earn-out payments in most of the Company's business acquisitions typically address the GAAP recognizable revenues achieved by the acquired entity over a one-, two-, and/or three-year period subsequent to the effective date of their acquisition by Ebix. These terms typically establish a minimum threshold revenue target to achieve over the agreed upon period post acquisition to earn the specified cash earn-out payment. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes these potential obligations as contingent liabilities and are reported as such on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in more detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement s , these contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, the total of these contingent liabilities was $0.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the total of these contingent liabilities was $10.1 million, of which $1.5 million was reported in long-term liabilities, and $8.6 million was included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Operating Activities For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2020 included net income of $92.4 million, adjusted for $3.6 million of net loss attributable to non-controlling interest, $13.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $6.2 million related to a non-cash intangible impairment loss, $4.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, $(19.9) million of working capital requirements, $(6.5) million of cash used to pay the Miles acquisition earn out, and $(3.1) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities. The increase in our operating cash flow in 43 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as COVID-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million (primarily related to the ItzCash acquisition earn out accrual) as compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million (primarily related to the Miles and Zillious acquisitions), both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company generated $60.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $26.5 million, or 30%. The major sources of cash provided by our operating activities during 2019 included net income of $96.7 million, less $6.1 million of net income attributable to a non-controlling interest, and net of $(16.5) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities, $(15.5) million of deferred tax benefits, $14.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $7.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $3.4 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $2.7 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, and $(26.5) million of working capital requirements. The primary cause for the decrease in our operating cash flow was the cash required to fund our substantially increased gross merchandise value (""GMV"") transactions for our travel and foreign exchange business and the $19.7 million paid to settle the derivative litigation matter discussed in Item 3 "" Legal Proceedings"". Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, primarily related to a $21.0 million decrease in investment in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposits), $14.3 million used for the acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million of capital expenditures to support our operations, and $4.2 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally. Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, totaled $96.7 million and consisted of $105.5 million used for acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million to reacquire Paul Merchant's 10% equity interest in Ebix’s combined international remittance business in India, $4.9 million of capital expenditures mainly in India to support our growing operations, and $8.0 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold and marketed, or used internally. Partially offsetting these outflows was $27.0 million from the net maturities of marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposit). Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $42.0 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in our working capital facilities in India, $20.7 million used to make scheduled payments against the Company’s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, and $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $905 thousand, and primarily consisted of $13.0 million used to reacquire 295 thousand shares of the Company's common stock, $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock, and $15.1 million used to make scheduled payments against the Credit Facility term loan. Partially offsetting this cash outflow was $13.5 million provided via borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, repayment of a $6.5 million short term loan that had been made to a third party, and $19.1 million net funds provided by the EbixCash working capital facilities in India. Credit Facility The Company maintains a senior secured syndicated credit facility, dated August 5, 2014, among Ebix, Inc., as borrower, its subsidiaries party thereto from time to time as guarantors, Regions Bank (as administrative agent and collateral agent) and the lenders party thereto from time to time (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) that provides a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as a term loan, which at December 31, 2020 had a balance of $255.5 million. The Credit Facility matures in February 2023. On May 7, 2020, Ebix entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Credit Facility. Amendment No. 10 provides for, among other things, increased flexibility under financial maintenance covenants, which the Company sought in part due to the unforeseen negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 44 On March 30, 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a waiver related to the Credit Facility (the ""Waiver""). The Waiver provided that so long as the Company’s leverage ratio is below 5.0 to 1.0 for the Company’s fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 pursuant to the terms of its compliance certificate required by the Credit Facility, the existing leverage ratio requirement of 3.50 to 1.0 was waived. On September 27, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 9 to the Credit Facility, which amended the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA"" and “Indebtedness”, and modified the maximum consolidated debt leverage ratios allowed. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility was $439.4 million and the facility carried an interest rate of 3.50%. The outstanding balance is included in the long-term liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2020, The company drew $1.4 million on its revolving line of credit. During 2020, the average and maximum outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit were $438.9 million and $439.4 million, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was 4.04%. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the term loan was $255.5 million, of which $22.6 million is due within the next twelve months. $20.7 million of scheduled amortization payments were made on the term loan during 2020. This term loan also carried an interest rate of 3.50% at December 31, 2020. The current and long-term portions of the term loan are included in the respective current and long-term liabilities sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amounts of which were $22.6 million and $232.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. During 2020, the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 4.04% Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known contractual debt and lease obligations as of December 31, 2020. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. Off Balance Sheet Transactions We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. Inflation We do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation could adversely affect our future operating results. 45","Ebix endeavors to provide on-demand software and e-commerce services to the insurance, financial, healthcare and e-learning industries. In the Insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy globally a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis, while also providing SaaS enterprise solutions in the area of CRM, front-end & back-end systems, outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The P&C exchanges operate primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. With a ""Phygital” strategy that combines over 320,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many (“ASEAN”) countries, to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, Forex, travel, pre-paid & gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management etc., in India and other markets. The Company’s Forex Exchange has the leading market share within India’s airport foreign exchange business and encompasses 20 international airports, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata International airports, all of which combined conducting over $4.8 billion in gross transaction value annually (pre-COVID-19). EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India conducts gross annual remittance of approximately $5 billion annually (pre-COVID-19) and is the clear market leader. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches and over 9,800 corporate clients, combined processing an estimated $2.5 billion in gross merchandise value per annum (pre-COVID-19). Through its various SaaS-based software platforms, Ebix employs thousands of domain-specific technology professionals to provide products, support and consultancy to thousands of customers on six continents.

    Ebix provides application software products for the insurance industry, including carrier systems, agency systems and exchanges, as well as custom software development. Approximately 88% of the Company’s revenues are either recurring or repeating (transaction-based) in nature. Rather than license the company's products in perpetuity, the company typically either licenses them for multiple years with ongoing support revenues or licenses them on a limited term basis using a subscription hosting or Application Service Provider (""ASP"") model. Combined subscription-based and transaction-based revenues of $552 million comprised 88% of the Company's total revenues in 2020, as compared to 84% of total revenues in 2019. In 2020, subscription-based revenues decreased by approximately $14 million to $164 million, and as a percentage of the Company's total revenues was 26% in 2020 versus 31% in 2019. The Company has modified the classification of certain revenues in 2020, which impacts the presentation of 2019 revenues and percentages above versus the 2019 10-K presentation.

    The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to products or services delivered over the company's exchanges or from the company's ASP, fees for business process outsourcing services, and fees for software development projects, including fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems, e-governance solutions to governmental agencies in the health and education sectors, as well as foreign exchange, remittance (both inward and outward) and travel services from the company's financial exchanges.
    During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company’s total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 8%, to $625.6 million compared to $580.6 million in 2019. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Across the U.S. and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. Countries across the world are re-opening economies, but are doing so in phases that differ in each country and, in many cases, within individual countries. While the company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses continue to be materially negatively impacted by COVID-19, the increase in 2020 total revenue year-over-year was due primarily to strong demand for the Company's payment solutions offerings in India (primarily prepaid gift cards), which increased by more than $200 million year-over-year to approximately $256 million, or 590% year-over-year growth. The increased demand for prepaid gift cards in India was primarily due to: (i) changes in regulations by the Reserve Bank of India related to debit cards, which has shifted demand in the market towards prepaid gift cards; (ii) COVID-19, which has facilitated increased online and electronic commerce due to restrictive lockdowns in 2020; and (iii) the Company's increased marketing efforts around the prepaid gift card business. The Company’s travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses had a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150 million, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, which offset the growth in the payments solutions business.

    Overall Exchange revenues increased $56.4 million, or 11%, as explained below:
•Insurance Exchange division revenues decreased by $12.0 million, or 6%, principally due to challenges faced in the company's health content services channel, and the negative effect of foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening U.S. dollar
•EbixCash Exchange division revenues increased $68.3 million, or 21%, due to a mix of organic growth and business acquisitions in the travel, foreign exchange, and software solutions sectors, offset by foreign exchange losses associated with the strengthening of the US Dollar.
•Risk Compliance Solutions division revenues decreased by $11.4 million, or 16%, primarily due to a decline in the company's U.S. professional consulting services associated with some major realignments in the sector.
    Costs of services provided, which includes costs associated with product sales, customer support, consulting, implementation, and training services increased $138.1 million, or 67%, from $205.2 million in 2019 to $343.3 million in 2020 and the Company's gross margin decreased to 45.1% in 2020 from 64.7% in 2019. The increase in costs of services provided and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 is directly related to the increase in over $200 million in revenue within the Company’s payment solutions business (primarily gift card revenue) in fiscal years 2020 versus 2019. Payment solutions gross margins are significantly lower than other solutions and services the Company provides its customers. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the payment solutions gross margins for the Company were approximately 1% and 9.5%, respectively. Excluding the payment solutions business, gross margins for the Company in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were approximately 76% and 68%, respectively. The increase in gross margins, excluding the payment solutions business, in fiscal year 2020 versus 2019 was driven by the revenue mix differences for the Company, with the Company’s highest margin solutions/services (e.g. insurance exchange software and services) experiencing less relative negative impact from COVID-19 during 2020 versus other solutions/services (e.g. travel, foreign exchange and remittance businesses).

    Interest expense decreased $10.8 million, or 25% from $42.3 million in 2019 to $31.6 million in 2020, primarily due to decrease LIBOR interest rates in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, The Company’s working capital facilities in India had average balances that were approximately $30 million lower in 2020 versus 2019. These working capital facilities generally carry interest rates of between 6.75% and 9.45%. The decrease in working capital facilities was associated with both COVID-19's impact on operations and renegotiated customer agreements that improved the Company’s payment terms in 2020 relative to 2019.
    The company’s principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by its operating activities, and cash and cash equivalents on hand. The company’s cash and cash equivalents were $105.0 million and $73.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions. The free flow of cash from certain countries where the company hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions. Furthermore, the repatriation of earnings from some of the company's foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the U.S. parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The major sources of cash provided by the company's operating activities during 2020 included net income of $92.4 million, adjusted for $3.6 million of net loss attributable to non-controlling interest, $13.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $6.1 million of amortization of right-of-use assets, $6.2 million related to a non-cash intangible impairment loss, $4.8 million of non-cash share-based compensation, $3.4 million of amortization expense for capitalized software development costs, $(19.9) million of working capital requirements, $(6.5) million of cash used to pay the Miles acquisition earn out, and $(3.1) million of non-cash gains recognized when reducing certain earn-out contingent liabilities. The increase in the company's operating cash flow in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as COVID-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million (primarily related to the ItzCash acquisition earn out accrual) as compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million (primarily related to the Miles and Zillious acquisitions), both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments.

    Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, primarily related to a $21.0 million decrease in investment in marketable securities (specifically bank certificates of deposits), $14.3 million used for the acquisitions during the year (net of cash acquired), $5.3 million of capital expenditures to support the company's operations, and $4.2 million used and capitalized in connection with the development of software to be sold/marketed or used internally.

    Net cash used by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $42.0 million, and primarily consisted of a $10.9 million decrease in the year-end balances in the company's working capital facilities in India, $20.7 million used to make scheduled payments against the Company’s outstanding Credit Facility term loan, and $9.2 million used to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of the company's common stock.

Credit Facility

The Company maintains a senior secured syndicated credit facility, dated August 5, 2014, among Ebix, Inc., as borrower, its subsidiaries party thereto from time to time as guarantors, Regions Bank (as administrative agent and collateral agent) and the lenders party thereto from time to time (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) that provides a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as a term loan, which at December 31, 2020 had a balance of $255.5 million.

Fiscal Year 2021 Highlights • Revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 were $119.8 million, an increase of 18% compared to revenues of $101.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. • Net income was $8.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to a net income of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. • Cash provided by operating activities was $37.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $24.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. • During fiscal 2021 the total number of financial institutions licensing our technology continued to exceed 7,500. All of the top 10 U.S. retail banks, and nearly all of the top 50 U.S. retail banks utilize our technology. • We added new patents to our portfolio during fiscal year 2021, bringing our total number of issued patents to 77 as of September 30, 2021. In addition, we have 18 patent applications as of September 30, 2021. Acquisition of ID R&amp;D, Inc. On May 28, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of ID R&amp;D (the “ID R&amp;D Acquisition”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated May 28, 2021, by and among the Company, ID R&amp;D and Alexey Khitrov. Upon completion of the ID R&amp;D Acquisition, ID R&amp;D became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Mitek Systems, Inc. ID R&amp;D is an award-winning provider of artificial intelligence-based voice and face biometrics and liveness detection. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to pay an aggregate purchase price of up to $49.0 million. On the Closing Date, the equityholders of ID R&amp;D received from the Company: (i) $13.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments for transaction expenses, escrow amounts, indebtedness and working capital adjustments and (ii) 867,226 shares (or $13.9 million) of 23 Common Stock. The terms of the Merger Agreement also provide for additional payments of up to approximately $22.1 million in a combination of cash and Common Stock upon the achievement of certain financial milestones during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Market Opportunities, Challenges, &amp; Risks We believe that financial institutions, fintechs, and other companies see our patented solutions as a way to provide a superior digital customer experience to meet growing consumer demand for trust and convenience online and, at the same time, assist them in meeting regulatory requirements. The value of digital transformation to our customers is a possible increase in top line revenue and a reduction in the cost of sales and services. As the use of new technology increases, so does associated fraud and cyber-attacks. The negative outcomes of fraud encompass financial losses, brand damage, and loss of loyal customers. We predict growth in both our deposits and identity verification products based on current trends in payments, online lending, more stringent regulations, growing usage of sharing apps and online marketplaces, and the ever-increasing demand for digital services. Factors adversely affecting the pricing of, or demand for, our digital solutions, such as competition from other products or technologies, any decline in the demand for digital transactions, or negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate, could result in lower revenues or gross margins. Further, because substantially all of our revenues are from a few types of technology, our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable to market demand and competition from other technologies, which could reduce our revenues. The sales cycle for our software and services can be lengthy and the implementation cycles for our software and services by our channel partners and customers can also be lengthy, often as long as six months and sometimes longer for larger customers. If implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers is delayed or otherwise not completed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Revenues related to most of our on-premise licenses for mobile products are required to be recognized up front upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria. Revenue related to our software as a service (“SaaS”) products is recognized ratably over the life of the contract or as transactions are used depending on the contract criteria. The recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the term of our license agreements, the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers, and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or license renewals by our channel partners and customers. During each of the last few years, sales of licenses to one or more channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each year. This is attributable to the timing of renewals or purchases of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel partner relationship, we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell our products to the end-users that had purchased products from the channel partner we lost. However, in that case, we or another channel partner must establish a relationship with the end-users, which could take time to develop, if it develops at all. We have a growing number of competitors in the mobile image capture and identity verification industry, many of which have greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. However, we believe our patented mobile image capture and identity verification technology, our growing portfolio of products and geographic coverage for the financial services industry, and our market expertise gives us a distinct competitive advantage. To remain competitive, we must continue to offer products that are attractive to the consumer as well as being secure, accurate, and convenient. To help us remain competitive, we intend to further strengthen performance of our portfolio of products through research and development as well as partnering with other technology providers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, concerns related to the spread of COVID-19 began to create global business disruptions as well as disruptions in our operations and to create potential negative impacts on our revenues and other financial results. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. We anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will negatively impact business activity across the globe. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, operations, and financial results is uncertain and difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration and severity of the outbreak. See Item 1A: “Risk Factors” for additional details. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has transitioned to working remotely and employee travel, including to our international subsidiaries, has been severely curtailed. It is not clear what the potential effects of any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers or vendors, or on our financial results. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and stockholders. We anticipate in certain circumstances that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may accelerate the adoption of digital technologies and create future opportunities and uses for our products. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our long term revenue growth and profitability, depends on certain 24 developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any resurgences, the severity of the disease, responsive actions taken by public health officials, the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines, the impacts on our customers’ and our sales cycles, our ability to generate new business leads, the impacts on our customers’, employee and industry events, and the effects on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and currently cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. As a result, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Because of our IT infrastructure and the nature of our business, our employees have generally been able to work remotely and productively, but future productivity and the effects of COVID-19 on our operations is unknown at this time. We continue to seek new and innovative opportunities to serve our customers’ needs. Results of Operations Certain amounts included herein differ from amounts reported in our preliminary unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations included in our earnings release dated November 4, 2021. The differences arose from an increase in acquisition-related costs and expenses of $0.4 million dollars due to the revaluation of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liability that was recorded as part of the ID R&amp;D Acquisition. We believe that these revised amounts are not materially different from those reported in the earnings release. Comparison of the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 The following table summarizes certain aspects of our results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 ( in thousands, except percentages ): Revenue Total revenue increased $18.5 million, or 18%, to $119.8 million in 2021 compared to $101.3 million in 2020. Software and hardware revenue increased $5.9 million, or 11%, to $60.1 million in 2021 compared to $54.2 million in 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase in sales of our Mobile Deposit®, ID_CLOUD ™, CheckReader™, and IDLive® Face software products. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our identity verification hardware products . Services and other revenue increased $12.6 million, or 27%, to $59.7 million in 2021 compared to $47.2 million in 2020. This increase is primarily due to strong growth in Mobile Verify® transactional SaaS revenue of $10.1 million, or 36%, in 2021 compared to 2020, as well as an increase in maintenance revenue associated with Mobile Deposit® software sales and hosted mobile deposit transactional revenue. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes personnel costs related to billable services and software support, direct costs associated with our hardware products, hosting costs, and the costs of royalties for third-party products embedded in our products. Cost of revenue increased $1.3 million, or 10%, to $14.5 million in 2021 compared to $13.2 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 12% in 2021 from 13% in 2020. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily due to an increase in variable personnel, hosting, and royalty costs associated with a higher volume of Mobile Verify® transactions processed during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was partially offset by decreased costs of our identity verification hardware products due to lower hardware revenues . 25 Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include non-billable costs of professional services personnel, advertising expenses, product promotion costs, trade shows, and other brand awareness programs. Selling and marketing expenses increased $4.9 million, or 18%, to $32.5 million in 2021 compared to $27.6 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses were consistent at 27% in 2021 and in 2020. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to higher personnel-related costs resulting from our increased headcount of $5.2 million and higher product promotion costs of $0.2 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The overall increase in selling and marketing expense was partially offset by a decrease in travel and related expenses of $0.5 million as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, and other headcount-related costs associated with software engineering and mobile image capture science. Research and development expenses increased $5.2 million, or 23%, to $28.0 million in 2021 compared to $22.9 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were consistent at 23% in 2021 and in 2020. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to higher personnel-related costs and third-party contractor expenses in 2021 compared to 2020. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, administration and information technology functions, as well as third-party legal, accounting, and other administrative costs. General and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, or 1%, to $22.5 million in 2021 compared to $22.3 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 19% in 2021 from 22% in 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher personnel-related costs resulting from our increased headcount of $1.6 million, higher executive transition costs of $0.4 million, and higher third-party professional fees of $0.4 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by decreased intellectual property litigation costs of $2.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Acquisition-Related Costs and Expenses Acquisition-related costs and expenses include amortization of intangible assets, expenses recorded due to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and other costs associated with acquisitions. Acquisition-related costs and expenses increased $2.4 million, or 36%, to $9.0 million in 2021 compared to $6.6 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, acquisition-related costs and expenses increased to 7% in 2021 from 6% in 2020. The increase in acquisition-related costs and expenses is primarily due to expenses associated with the acquisition of ID R&amp;D in 2021 as compared to 2020. Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs consist of employee severance obligations and other related costs. There were no restructuring costs in 2021. Restructuring costs were negative $0.1 million in 2020 due to a reversal of costs accrued for the restructuring plan implemented in June 2019. Interest Expense Interest expense includes the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and coupon interest incurred associated with our 2026 Notes. Interest expense was $5.1 million in 2021 and consisted of $4.4 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and $0.8 million of coupon interest incurred. There was no interest expense in 2020. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income net of amortization and net realized gains or losses on our marketable securities portfolio, foreign currency transactional gains or losses, and the change in fair value of our convertible senior notes hedge and embedded conversion derivative. Other income, net increased $0.1 million, to a net income of $0.7 million in 2021 compared to a net income of $0.5 million in 2020, primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange transactional gains in 2021 compared to 2020. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for 2021 was $0.8 million compared to an income tax provision of $1.6 million in 2020. The income tax provision for 2021 was primarily due to our positive net income for the year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to changes in our deferred tax benefit of $1.6 million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards. 26 Results of Operations Comparison of the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 The following table summarizes certain aspects of our results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 ( in thousands, except percentages ): (1) 2019 amounts reflect reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Total revenue increased $16.7 million, or 20%, to $101.3 million in 2020 compared to $84.6 million in 2019. Software and hardware revenue increased $7.3 million, or 16%, to $54.2 million in 2020 compared to $46.8 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to an increase in sales of our Mobile Deposit®, ID_CLOUD ™, and CheckReader™ software products. The increase was partially offset by declining software revenue from our legacy on-premise identity products which are being phased out. Services and other revenue increased $9.4 million, or 25%, to $47.2 million in 2020 compared to $37.7 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to strong growth in Mobile Verify® transactional SaaS revenue of $7.7 million, or 36%, in 2020 compared to 2019, as well as an increase in maintenance revenue associated with CheckReader™ and Mobile Deposit® software sales. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes personnel costs related to billable services and software support, direct costs associated with our hardware products, hosting costs, and the costs of royalties for third-party products embedded in our products. Cost of revenue increased $0.9 million, or 8%, to $13.2 million in 2020 compared to $12.3 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 13% in 2020 from 15% in 2019. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily due to an increase in variable personnel, royalty, and hosting costs associated with a higher volume of Mobile Verify® transactions processed during 2020 compared to 2019. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include non-billable costs of professional services personnel, advertising expenses, product promotion costs, trade shows, and other brand awareness programs. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.1 million, or 13%, to $27.6 million in 2020 compared to $24.6 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 27% in 2020 from 29% in 2019. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to higher personnel-related costs of $2.9 million resulting from our increased headcount in 2020 compared to 2019, and higher product promotion costs of $0.8 million in 2020. Prior to fiscal 2020, the Company had included its product management costs in selling and marketing expenses. Due to certain personnel and functional responsibility changes in this function, the Company has reclassified these costs to research and development expenses. To conform to the current period’s presentation, prior year’s financials have been reclassified accordingly. The Company has determined that this reclassification was not material to previously reported financial statements. Product management costs were $3.0 million and $2.9 million in the twelve months ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. 27 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, product management and other headcount-related costs associated with software engineering and mobile image capture science. Research and development expenses increased $1.0 million, or 5%, to $22.9 million in 2020 compared to $21.9 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 23% in 2020 from 26% in 2019. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to higher personnel-related costs in 2020 compared to 2019. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, administration and information technology functions, as well as third-party legal, accounting, and other administrative costs. General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 12%, to $22.3 million in 2020 compared to $19.9 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22% in 2020 from 23% in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in intellectual property litigation costs of $2.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, a $1.0 million insurance settlement received in 2019 and a $0.4 million increase in third-party outside service costs. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in third-party costs associated with our strategic process of $1.2 million incurred in 2019, compared to $0 in 2020. Acquisition-Related Costs and Expenses Acquisition-related costs and expenses include amortization of intangible assets, expenses recorded due to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, stock-based compensation, and other costs associated with acquisitions. Acquisition-related costs and expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 13%, to $6.6 million in 2020 compared to $7.6 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenue, acquisition-related costs and expenses decreased to 6% in 2020 from 9% in 2019. The decrease in acquisition-related costs and expenses is primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets of $0.6 million as certain assets associated with the ICAR Acquisition became fully amortized during 2020 and a decrease in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.3 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs consist of employee severance obligations and other related costs. Restructuring costs were negative $0.1 million in 2020 and are due to a reversal of costs accrued for the restructuring plan implemented in June 2019. Restructuring costs were $3.1 million in 2019 and related to the restructuring plan implemented in June 2019. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income net of amortization and net realized gains or losses on our marketable securities portfolio, foreign currency transactional gains or losses, and interest expense. Other income, net decreased $0.1 million, to a net income of $0.5 million in 2020 compared to a net income of $0.6 million in 2019, primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange transactional gains in 2020 compared to 2019. Income Tax Benefit (Provision) The income tax provision for 2020 was $1.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $3.3 million in 2019. The income tax provision for 2020 was primarily due to our positive net income for the year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the impact of federal and state research and development credits and the impact of foreign and state taxes. The income tax benefit of $3.3 million in 2019 was primarily due to changes in our deferred tax benefit of $3.2 million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, as well as additional research and development credits associated with the provision to return true-up. Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 30, 2021, we had $227.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and investments compared to $62.0 million on September 30, 2020, an increase of $165.4 million, or 267%. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $140.5 million (net of sale of warrants and purchase of convertible senior notes hedge), net cash provided by operating activities of $37.3 million, and net proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock under our equity plan of $4.0 million. These increases were partially offset by net cash paid in conjunction with the ID R&amp;D Acquisition of $12.5 million, capital expenditures of $1.4 million, the payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 million, unfavorable foreign currency losses of $0.2 million, repurchases and retirements of common stock of $0.2 million, and principal payments on other borrowings of $0.1 million. 28 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $37.3 million and resulted primarily from net income of $8.0 million, net non-cash charges of $27.3 million, and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. The primary non-cash adjustments to operating activities were stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, accretion and amortization on debt securities, depreciation and amortization, amortization of investment premiums &amp; other, net changes in estimated fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and deferred taxes totaling $11.5 million, $7.5 million, $4.4 million, $1.4 million, $1.3 million, $1.1 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was $24.1 million and resulted primarily from net income of $7.8 million adjusted for net non-cash charges of $19.6 million partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3.3 million. The primary non-cash adjustments to operating activities were stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, and deferred taxes totaling $9.6 million, $6.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $170.5 million during fiscal 2021, which consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $156.6 million, net cash paid in conjunction with the ID R&amp;D Acquisition of $12.5 million, and capital expenditures of $1.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $24.7 million during fiscal 2020, which consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $23.9 million and capital expenditures of $0.8 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $143.7 million during fiscal 2021, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $149.7 million, proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock of $4.0 million and net proceeds from other borrowings of $0.2 million, partially offset by net cash used for the call spreads on the sales and purchases of warrants and convertible senior notes hedge issued in connection with the 2026 Notes of $9.3 million, payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 million, and repurchases and retirements of Common Stock of $0.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 million during fiscal 2020, which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock of $4.8 million and net proceeds from other borrowings of $0.1 million, partially offset by repurchases and retirements of Common Stock of $1.0 million and payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.5 million. 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 In February 2021, the Company issued $155.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated February 5, 2021 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $149.7 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s estimated offering expenses related to the offering. The 2026 Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The 2026 Notes will bear interest from February 5, 2021 at a rate of 0.750% per year payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s Common Stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Common Stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; and (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Common Stock. On or after August 1, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash and, if applicable at the Company’s election, shares of Common Stock, based on the applicable conversion rate(s); provided that the Company will be required to settle conversions solely in cash unless and until the Company (i) receives stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock and (ii) reserves such amount of shares of the Common Stock for future issuance as required pursuant to the indenture that will govern 29 the 2026 Notes. The conversion rate for the 2026 Notes will initially be 47.9731 shares of the Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.85 per share of the Common Stock. The initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes represents a premium of approximately 37.5% to the $15.16 per share last reported sale price of the Common Stock on February 2, 2021. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The impact of the convertible feature will be dilutive to our earnings per share when our average stock price for the period is greater than the conversion price. In connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we entered into transactions for convertible notes hedge (the “Notes Hedge”) and warrants (the “Warrant Transactions”). The Notes Hedge was entered into with Bank of America, N.A., Jefferies International Limited and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, and provided the Company with the option to acquire, on a net settlement basis, approximately 7.4 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of $20.85, which is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that notionally underlie and corresponds to the conversion price of the 2026 Notes. The cost of the Notes Hedge was $33.2 million. The Notes Hedge will expire on February 1, 2026, equal to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes. The Notes Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2026 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our Common Stock exceeds the strike price of the Notes Hedge. In addition, the Warrant Transactions provided us with the ability to acquire up to 7.4 million shares of our Common Stock. The Warrant Transactions will expire ratably during the 80 trading days commencing on and including May 1, 2026 and may be settled in net shares of Common Stock or net cash at the Company’s election. We received $23.9 million in cash proceeds from the Warrant Transactions. As a result of the Warrant Transactions, the Company is required to recognize incremental dilution of earnings per share to the extent the average share price is over $26.53 for any fiscal quarter. As of December 10, 2021, the 2026 Notes were not convertible, therefore, we had not purchased any shares under the Notes Hedge and the Warrant Transactions had not been exercised and remain outstanding. See Note 8. “Convertible Senior Notes,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part IV. of this Form 10-K for more information relating to the Notes Hedge and Warrant Transactions. Rights Agreement On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into the Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) and issued a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of Common Stock payable on November 2, 2018 to the stockholders of record of such shares on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), of the Company, at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement). Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. At any time prior to the time any person becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (the “Redemption Price”). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price. On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Agreement for the purpose of (i) modifying the definitions of “Beneficial Owner,” “Beneficially Own,” and “Beneficial Ownership” under the Rights Agreement to more closely align such definitions to the actual and constructive ownership rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”) or such similar provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) adding an exemption request process for persons to seek an exemption from becoming an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement in the event such person wishes to acquire 4.9% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding. The Rights expired on October 22, 2021 and no Rights were redeemed or exchanged. Share Repurchase Program On June 15, 2021, the Board authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $15 million of the currently outstanding shares of our Common Stock. The share repurchase program will expire on June 30, 2022. The timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. The repurchases may be made from time to time, through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to a share repurchase trading plan. The program may be discontinued or amended at any time. The Company made purchases of $0.2 million, or 10,555 shares, during fiscal 2021 at an average price of $17.99 per share. 30 From the period October 1, 2021 through December 10, 2021, the Company made purchases of $8.1 million, or 474,213 shares at an average price of $17.09 per share. On December 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $10.0 million of the currently outstanding shares of our Common Stock. The share repurchase program expired on December 16, 2020. Total purchases made under the share repurchase program were $1.0 million or approximately 137,000 shares at an average price of $7.33 per share. The purchases under the share repurchase program were made through open market trades. CARES Act On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act” (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company continues to examine the impacts the CARES Act may have on our business. Lease Obligations Our principal executive offices, as well as our research and development facility, are located in approximately 29,000 square feet of office space in San Diego, California and the term of the lease continues through June 30, 2024. The average annual base rent under this lease is approximately $1.2 million per year. In connection with this lease, we received tenant improvement allowances totaling approximately $1.0 million. These lease incentives are being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease. Our other offices are located in Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and London, United Kingdom. The term of the Paris, France lease continues through May 31, 2025, with an annual base rent of approximately €418 thousand (or $484 thousand). The term of the Amsterdam, The Netherlands lease continues through December 31, 2022, with an annual base rent of approximately €191 thousand (or $222 thousand). The term of the New York, New York lease continues through November 30, 2024, with an annual base rent of approximately $195 thousand. The term of the Barcelona, Spain lease continues through May 31, 2023, with an annual base rent of approximately €97 thousand (or $113 thousand). The term of the London, United Kingdom lease continues through May 31, 2022, with an annual base rent of approximately £112 thousand (or approximately $151 thousand). Other than the lease for our office space in San Diego, California, we do not believe that the leases for our offices are material to the Company. We believe our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of its business. Other Liquidity Matters On September 30, 2021, we had investments of $197.1 million, designated as available-for-sale debt securities, which consisted of U.S. Treasury notes, asset-backed securities, foreign government and agency securities, and corporate issuances, carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for identical or similar assets, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. All securities for which maturity or sale is expected within one year are classified as “current” on the consolidated balance sheets. All other securities are classified as “long-term” on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2021, we had $149.1 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as current and $48.1 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as long-term. At September 30, 2020, we had $40.0 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as current and $2.0 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as long-term. We had working capital of $164.8 million at September 30, 2021 compared to $59.8 million at September 30, 2020. Based on our current operating plan, we believe the current cash balance and cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our working capital needs for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are filed. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and form the basis for making management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are 31 inherently uncertain. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We enter into contractual arrangements with integrators, resellers, and directly with our customers that may include licensing of our software products, product support and maintenance services, SaaS services, consulting services, or various combinations thereof, including the sale of such products or services separately. Our accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements are fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : • Identification of the contract with a customer; • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; • Determination of transaction price; • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and • Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Software and Hardware Software and hardware revenue is generated from on premise software license sales, as well as sales of hardware scanner boxes and on premise appliance products. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery and after evidence of a contract exists. Hardware revenue is recognized in the period that the hardware is shipped. Services and Other Services and other revenue is generated from the sale of transactional SaaS products and services, maintenance associated with the sale of software and hardware, and consulting and professional services. We recognize services and other revenue over the period in which such services are performed. Our model typically includes an up-front fee and a periodic commitment from the customer that commences upon completion of the implementation through the remainder of the customer life. The up-front fee is the initial setup fee, or the implementation fee. The periodic commitment includes, but is not limited to, a fixed periodic fee and/or a transactional fee based on system usage that exceeds committed minimums. If the up-front fee is not distinct, revenue is deferred until the date the customer commences use of our services, at which point the up-front fee is recognized ratably over the life of the customer arrangement. We do not view the signing of the contract or the provision of initial setup services as discrete earnings events that are distinct. Contract Assets and Liabilities The Company recognizes revenue when control of the license or transactional SaaS service is transferred to the customer. The Company records a contract asset when the revenue is recognized prior to the date payments become due. Contract assets that are expected to be paid within one year are recorded in current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All other contract assets are recorded in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. When the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled within one year, the deferred revenue is recorded in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. When the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled beyond one year, the deferred revenue is recorded in non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reports net contract asset or liability positions on a customer-by-customer basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract Costs The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract, consisting primarily of sales commissions incurred only if a contract is obtained. When the commission rate for a customer renewal is not commensurate with the commission rate for a new contract, the commission is capitalized if expected to be recovered. Such costs are capitalized and amortized using a portfolio approach consistent with the pattern of transfer of the good or service to which the asset relates. Contract costs are recorded in other current and non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Significant Judgments We use the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service 32 is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price, including any discounts, is allocated between separate goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service. Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as: (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. Accounts Receivable We consistently monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific customer collection issues. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Since our revenue recognition policy requires customers to be deemed creditworthy, our accounts receivable are based on customers whose payment is reasonably assured. Our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide variety of customers. We do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. Convertible Senior Notes Hedge and Embedded Conversion Derivative In February 2021, the Company issued $155.3 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750% convertible notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). Concurrently with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible senior note hedge (the “Notes Hedge”) and warrant transactions (the “Warrant Transactions”) which, in combination, are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2026 Notes. The Company could not elect to issue the shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”) upon settlement of the 2026 Notes due to insufficient authorized share capital. As a result, the embedded conversion option (the “embedded conversion derivative”) is accounted for as a derivative liability and the Notes Hedge as a derivative asset with the resulting gain (or loss) was reported in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent the valuation changed from the date of issuance of the 2026 Notes. The Warrant Transactions were recorded in additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated balance sheet and are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. See Note 8. “Convertible Senior Notes” for additional information related to these transactions. Investments We determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value: • Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and • Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 33 In using this fair value hierarchy, management may be required to make assumptions about pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk, specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value. These assumptions are subjective in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations. Fair Value of Equity Instruments The valuation of certain items, including compensation expense related to equity awards granted, involves significant estimates based on underlying assumptions made by management. The valuation of stock options is based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model, which involves estimates of stock volatility, expected life of the instruments and other assumptions. The valuation of performance options, Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Restricted Stock Units, and similar awards are based upon the Monte-Carlo simulation, which involves estimates of our stock price, expected volatility, and the probability of reaching the performance targets. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Our goodwill resulted from prior acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from two to seven years. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate that their value may no longer be recoverable. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”), we review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of our reporting unit and/or our indefinite-lived intangible asset below their respective carrying values. Examples of such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant decline in our stock price, a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit. Our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds management’s estimate of its fair value. Based on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting , (“ASC Topic 280”) management has determined that the Company operates in one segment and consists of one reporting unit. Because we have only one reporting unit, and because we are publicly traded, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. Our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets to our market capitalization. Because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization, our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of our Common Stock. For example, a significant decline in the price of our Common Stock may cause the fair value of our goodwill to fall below its carrying value. Therefore, we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Each period, we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. The carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value if the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of such assets. No impairment charge related to the impairment of intangible assets was recorded during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Business Combinations Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from license sales, software services contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents; 34 • the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; • uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and • discount rates. Accounting for Income Taxes We estimate income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our balance sheets. We then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statements of operations. We review the need for a valuation allowance each interim period to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has more than a 50% chance of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. Capitalized Software Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established. These capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and changes in hardware and software technologies. Costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead. No such costs were capitalized during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 because the time period and cost incurred between technological feasibility and general release for all software product releases were not material. Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet our internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. The Company defines the design, configuration, and coding process as the application development stage. The Company capitalized $0.8 million and $0.3 million of costs related to computer software developed for internal use during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.4 million of amortization expense from internal use software during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.","Mitek is a leading innovator of mobile image capture and digital identity verification solutions.

Fiscal Year 2021 Highlights

•Revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 were $119.8 million, an increase of 18% compared to revenues of $101.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.
•Net income was $8.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to a net income of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.
•Cash provided by operating activities was $37.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $24.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.
•During fiscal 2021 the total number of financial institutions licensing the company's  technology continued to exceed 7,500. All of the top 10 U.S. retail banks, and nearly all of the top 50 U.S. retail banks utilize the company's  technology.
•the company added new patents to the company's  portfolio during fiscal year 2021, bringing the company's  total number of issued patents to 77 as of September 30, 2021. In addition, the company has 18 patent applications as of September 30, 2021.
Total revenue increased $16.7 million, or 20%, to $101.3 million in 2020 compared to $84.6 million in 2019. Software and hardware revenue increased $7.3 million, or 16%, to $54.2 million in 2020 compared to $46.8 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to an increase in sales of the company's  Mobile Deposit®, ID_CLOUD™, and CheckReader™ software products. The increase was partially offset by declining software revenue from the company's  legacy on-premise identity products which are being phased out. Services and other revenue increased $9.4 million, or 25%, to $47.2 million in 2020 compared to $37.7 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to strong growth in Mobile Verify® transactional SaaS revenue of $7.7 million, or 36%, in 2020 compared to 2019, as well as an increase in maintenance revenue associated with CheckReader™ and Mobile Deposit® software sales.
On September 30, 2021, the company had $227.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and investments compared to $62.0 million on September 30, 2020, an increase of $165.4 million, or 267%. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $140.5 million (net of sale of warrants and purchase of convertible senior notes hedge), net cash provided by operating activities of $37.3 million, and net proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock under the company's  equity plan of $4.0 million. These increases were partially offset by net cash paid in conjunction with the ID R&D Acquisition of $12.5 million, capital expenditures of $1.4 million, the payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 million, unfavorable foreign currency losses of $0.2 million, repurchases and retirements of common stock of $0.2 million, and principal payments on other borrowings of $0.1 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $37.3 million and resulted primarily from net income of $8.0 million, net non-cash charges of $27.3 million, and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. The primary non-cash adjustments to operating activities were stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, accretion and amortization on debt securities, depreciation and amortization, amortization of investment premiums & other, net changes in estimated fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and deferred taxes totaling $11.5 million, $7.5 million, $4.4 million, $1.4 million, $1.3 million, $1.1 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities was $170.5 million during fiscal 2021, which consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $156.6 million, net cash paid in conjunction with the ID R&D Acquisition of $12.5 million, and capital expenditures of $1.4 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $143.7 million during fiscal 2021, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $149.7 million, proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock of $4.0 million and net proceeds from other borrowings of $0.2 million, partially offset by net cash used for the call spreads on the sales and purchases of warrants and convertible senior notes hedge issued in connection with the 2026 Notes of $9.3 million, payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 million, and repurchases and retirements of Common Stock of $0.2 million.
In February 2021, the Company issued $155.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated February 5, 2021 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable.

"You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in the section titled “Note About Forward-Looking Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Statement on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31. Overview Slack is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but at nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the year ended January 31, 2021. Further, Slack’s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization’s internally-developed software. We generate revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions for Slack. Paid customers typically pay on a monthly or annual basis, based on the number of users that they have on Slack. We offer four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of organizations on Slack: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. We have a fair billing policy under which certain paid customers are charged a fee per user, and their billing is reconciled on a monthly or quarterly basis based on usage. As part of this policy, these paid customers are entitled to a credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. Other paid customers have a type of subscription agreement where they are charged a fee based on the number of purchased user subscriptions, but billing is fixed and independent of usage. We serve organizations of all sizes across various industries, ranging from software companies to consumer retail companies, financial services companies, and government entities. Slack is currently used in over 150 countries and available in ten languages (English (U.S.), English (U.K.), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin America), and Spanish (Spain)). In the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 39%, 37%, and 36%, respectively, of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. Our go-to-market approach combines a web-based, self-service approach with direct sales efforts that focus on growing users within larger organizations that generally already have Slack users and acquiring new large organizations as paid customers. We believe that these go-to-market approaches reinforce one another; self-service users often become leads for our direct sales force and users within larger enterprises create organic awareness of Slack inside and outside of their organizations. We complement these activities with an obsessive focus on customer experience and customer success to support the growth of the number of users on free and paid subscriptions. We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. Our revenue was $902.6 million, $630.4 million, and $400.6 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing annual growth of 43% and 57%, respectively. We generated net losses for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 of $300.4 million, $571.1 million, and $140.7 million, respectively, which included $227.4 million, $426.5 million, and $23.1 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. Our net losses excluding the impact from stock-based compensation have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over time as revenue growth has outpaced the 72 growth in operating expenses. We plan to continue to invest in adding organizations to Slack in order to increase our revenues, decrease our operating losses, and eventually reach profitability. However, there can be no guarantee as to when we will eventually reach profitability, if at all. Proposed Transaction with Salesforce On December 1, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub I with and into Slack, with Slack continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce, or the First Merger, immediately followed by a second merger of the surviving corporation into either Merger Sub II or Salesforce, or the Second Merger, with either Merger Sub II or Salesforce continuing as the surviving company. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be converted into the right to receive (a) 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock and (b) $26.79 in cash, without interest. The Mergers are intended to be treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As a result of the Mergers, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The consummation of the Mergers is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to a financing condition. In March 2021, our stockholders approved the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers. The Mergers are anticipated to close in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022 (the quarter ending July 31, 2021), subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. We cannot predict with certainty, however, whether and when all of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if the Mergers will close. The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for us and Salesforce, including if the First Merger is not consummated by August 1, 2021, subject to two extensions of up to three months each in order to obtain required regulatory approvals. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, including (i) a termination by us to enter into a superior proposal, (ii) a termination by Salesforce following a change or withdrawal of the Company’s board of directors’ recommendation of the Mergers to our stockholders, or (iii) a termination by Salesforce as a result of a material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay to Salesforce a termination fee equal to $900.0 million in cash. As part of Salesforce after the completion of the Mergers, we expect our company will be positioned to scale and further our mission. Following the completion of the Mergers, Slack will become an operating unit of Salesforce and continue to be led by our Chief Executive Officer, Stewart Butterfield, driving forward a continued focus on our mission, customers, users, and community. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Proposed Transaction with Salesforce” included under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the risks associated with the Mergers. The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 1, 2020 and incorporated by reference herein. COVID-19 Update In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related public health measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. 73 We have experienced volatility in customer demand and buying habits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in net new Paid Customers, but also an increase in paid customer churn and a decrease in expansion within existing paid customers during the year ended January 31, 2021. We expect these paid customer churn and expansion trends to continue due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We define paid customer churn as paid customers reducing the number of users within their organizations or electing not to renew their paid subscriptions. The COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have been more prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, suppliers, and third-party business partners conduct business. This outbreak, as well as intensified measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, have decreased IT spending for many organizations, adversely affected demand for Slack including attrition rates, and inhibited the ability of our salespeople to travel to potential customers and of our customer success team to conduct in-person trainings and consulting work. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted spending from certain new and existing customers, increased sales cycle times, negatively impacted collections of accounts receivable, caused certain of our paid customers to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, and harmed our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We expect these negative impacts will continue due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, to prepare for potential surges in demand, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional costs and make additional investments in order to meet the demands of increased customer usage of Slack and additional product development efforts during this time may put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure. The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and any prolonged economic slowdowns may continue to result in, paid customers on Slack requesting to renegotiate existing contracts on less advantageous terms to us than those currently in place, defaulting on payments due on existing contracts, not renewing at the end of the contract term, or choosing to renew with a smaller commitment than previous contracts. For example, in an effort to assist both new and existing paid customers facing challenges due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, more custom contracts and billing arrangements with new and existing paid customers, which may be less advantageous to us than our standard term contracts. These arrangements have included provisions such as the ability to defer payments, to pay in installments or over longer time periods, and other collection flexibility. We have also granted, and may in the future grant, billing concessions to existing paid customers. We do not expect these billing arrangements to have a significant impact on our future revenue, but they will negatively impact our future Calculated Billings and Free Cash Flow. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents challenges as our entire workforce is currently working remotely and shifting to assisting new and existing customers who are also generally working remotely. All of our currently planned customer, employee, and industry events have been shifted to virtual-only experiences, and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone, or cancel entirely, additional customer, partner, employee, or industry events in the future. Furthermore, in June 2020, we announced that we would allow many of our employees to work remotely on a permanent basis. We have a limited history of having a remote workforce and the long-term impact on, and the resulting types of continuing investments for, our employee base is uncertain. In addition, we may incur increased workforce costs, including costs associated with implementing additional personnel and workplace safety protocols, the accrual of unused paid time off, and workplace or labor claims and disputes related to COVID-19. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the potential negative impact of the outbreak on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn will likely limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. We are continuing to understand the long-term net effect and anticipated future magnitude of the above factors on our results for future periods and such forecasts are inherently uncertain. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 74 Key Business Metrics We review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies who may calculate similarly-titled metrics in a different way. We define an organization as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer, and when disclosing the number of Paid Customers, we round down to the nearest thousand. Paid Customers We believe that the growth in our Paid Customer base reflects our value proposition and positions us for future growth as our Paid Customers often expand their adoption over time and Paid Customers increase awareness of Slack, which leads to organic adoption by new organizations. Our Paid Customers base has expanded through increasing awareness of Slack, further developing our go-to-market strategy and continuing to build features tuned to different industry needs. Our Paid Customer base includes organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries. Paid Customers &gt;$100,000 We focus on growing the number of Paid Customers &gt;$100,000 as a measure of our ability to scale with organizations on Slack and attract larger organizations to Slack. We believe that our ability to increase the number of Paid Customers &gt;$100,000 is a key indicator for important components of the growth of our business, including our success in expanding the number of users within a Paid Customer, providing the functionality required by large organizations and developing our direct sales force. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 49%, 46%, and 40%, respectively, of our revenue was generated from our Paid Customers &gt;$100,000. We define Paid Customers &gt;$100,000 as those organizations on a paid subscription plan that had more than $100,000 in ARR as of a period end. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is reconciled on a monthly or quarterly basis based on usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of active subscriptions as of the month end. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is fixed and independent of usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of purchased subscriptions. Net Dollar Retention Rate We disclose Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of our organic revenue growth. We believe Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our Paid Customers. We calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. We then calculate the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR. Current Period MRR includes expansion within Paid Customers and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new Paid Customers in the current period, including those organizations that were only on Free subscription plans in the 75 prior period and converted to paid subscription plans during the current period. We then divide the total Current Period MRR by the total Prior Period MRR to arrive at our Net Dollar Retention Rate. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate has declined from 143% as of January 31, 2019 to 132% as of January 31, 2020 to 123% as of January 31, 2021 as our base of revenue has grown the past few years and our penetration within existing, long-term Paid Customers has increased. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our Paid Customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Paid Customers. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the below non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance . We use the below non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Calculated Billings Calculated Billings consists of our revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue in a given period. The Calculated Billings metric is intended to reflect sales to new paid customers plus renewals and additional sales to existing paid customers. Our management uses Calculated Billings to measure and monitor our sales growth because we generally bill our paid customers at the time of sale, but may recognize a portion of the related revenue ratably over time. For subscriptions, we typically invoice our paid customers at the beginning of the term, in annual or monthly installments and, from time to time, in multi-year installments. Only amounts invoiced to a paid customer in a given period are included in Calculated Billings. While we believe that Calculated Billings provides valuable insight into the cash that will be generated from sales of our subscriptions, this metric may vary from period-to-period for a number of reasons, and therefore has a number of limitations as a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparative measure. These reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) a variety of contractual terms could result in some periods having a higher proportion of annual subscriptions than other periods, (ii) as we focus on sales to large organizations, the lengthening of our sales cycle, and the variability in the timing of the execution of these larger transactions, (iii) fluctuations in payment terms affecting the billings recognized in a particular period, and (iv) seasonality in our billings, with a greater proportion of our billings occurring in our fourth quarter, following typical enterprise software buying patterns. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Calculated Billings along with revenue and our other GAAP financial results. 76 The following table presents a reconciliation of revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Calculated Billings, for each of the periods presented: Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our balance sheet. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of Free Cash Flow are that this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue in future periods. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented and provides a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Free Cash Flow for each of the periods presented: Key Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate substantially all of our revenue through sales of subscriptions of Slack to organizations. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract subscription period beginning on the date access to Slack is granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our subscriptions are generally non-cancellable and typically do not contain general rights of return. We maintain a fair billing policy, under which certain organizations on a paid subscription plan are entitled to credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. These credits, accounted for as a part of deferred revenue, may be carried over to offset future billings and are not refundable for cash. On occasion, we also provide professional services to organizations on Slack. Professional services revenue has not been material to date. 77 Overhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs We allocate shared costs, such as facilities (including rent, utilities, and depreciation on equipment shared by all departments) and information technology (IT) costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category. Employee compensation costs, or personnel costs, include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for cost of revenue and each operating expense category and also include sales commissions for sales and marketing. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to hosting Slack and providing ongoing customer support for paid customers. These expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related expenses for customer experience, professional services, and technical operations staff, payments to outside service providers, third-party hosting costs, payment processing fees, and amortization expense associated with internally-developed and purchased technology . We expect our cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we grow our business and revenue. Operating Expenses Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining and enhancing existing functionality of, and adding new functionality to, Slack. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing new features and enhancements. We expect, however, that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our research and development expenses. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses associated with our marketing and business development programs, including Frontiers, our annual user conference. Sales and marketing expenses also include allocated third-party hosting costs as well as customer experience and technical operations employee overhead costs for users of our free version of Slack. Sales commissions that are directly related to acquiring sales contracts, as well as associated payroll taxes, are deferred upon execution of a non-cancellable contract with an organization, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense over the estimated period of benefit, typically four years. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future, primarily for increased headcount for our direct sales organization and investment in brand and product marketing efforts. We expect to continue to incur sales and marketing expenses to the extent that we continue to see a high-growth market opportunity to support the growth of our business. If the growth in our business lessens over time, we plan to decrease the rate of growth in our sales and marketing expenses. We expect, however, that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams as well as for certain executives and professional fees, including audit, legal, and recruiting services. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We also expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenues over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. 78 Interest Expense In April 2020, we completed the private offering of the Notes, issuing $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due April 15, 2025. After our issuance of the Notes, interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs on the Notes. Interest Income and Other Income, Net Interest income and other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and gains or losses on foreign currency exchange. Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal, state income taxes, and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Since inception, we have incurred operating losses and, accordingly, have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than provisions for foreign income tax. As of January 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for both federal and state income tax purposes of $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $110.4 million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $81.5 million. Since the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $776.0 million as of January 31, 2021, against our net deferred tax asset balance of $779.9 million. If not utilized, a portion of the federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. Utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation that is applicable if we experience an “ownership change” through a change in significant stockholder allocation or equity structure. 79 Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue: __________________ (1) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: (2) Our consolidated financial statements include our majority-owned subsidiary, Slack Fund. The ownership interest of minority investors in Slack Fund is recorded as a noncontrolling interest. 80 Comparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 Revenue and Cost of Revenue Revenue increased $272.2 million, or 43%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in revenue was primarily due to expansion within our existing Paid Customers, as reflected by our Net Dollar Retention Rate of 123% as of January 31, 2021, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as our number of Paid Customers increased by 42% in the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, revenue generated from Paid Customers &gt; $100,000 in the year ended January 31, 2021 increased to 49% compared to 46% in the year ended January 31, 2020 . Cost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 25%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an $18.0 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, a $9.9 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.0 million increase in credit card payment processing fees as the volume of sales transactions increased. These increases were partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. 81 Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased $75.2 million, or 16%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $117.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, a $3.4 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and a $3.1 million decrease in corporate expenses mainly related to local business taxes. This decrease was partially offset by a $47.5 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $57.9 million, or 14%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $66.3 million increase in personnel costs, which include customer experience and infrastructure employee costs for users of our free version, a $21.3 million increase in marketing expenses due to more spending on brand and advertising, a $14.5 million increase in third-party hosting costs for users on a Free subscription plan of Slack, primarily due to continuing growth in our user base, and a $4.7 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth. This increase was partially offset by a $40.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, and an $8.5 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses decreased $40.2 million, or 15%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $44.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, a $30.4 million decrease in fees related to financial advisory services, audit, and legal expenses, which we incurred in connection with the Direct Listing, and a $5.5 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. This decrease was partially offset by a $24.7 million increase in legal fees and acquisition-related costs that include transaction expenses associated with the proposed merger with Salesforce of $8.7 million , and a $16.6 million increase in personnel costs related to increases in our administrative, finance and accounting, legal, IT, and human resources headcount. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $37.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 due to contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the Notes issued in April 2020. 82 Interest Income and Other Income, Net Interest income and other income, net was $28.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2021, an increase of $7.0 million from the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in interest income and other income, net was primarily driven by a net increase in realized and unrealized gains from our strategic investments of $14.7 million, and an increase of net foreign exchange gains of $3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of interest income of $10.4 million due primarily to a decrease in interest rates. Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes The benefit from income taxes was $0.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2021, compared to the provision for income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from stock-based compensation in our foreign jurisdictions. Comparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 Revenue and Cost of Revenue Revenue increased $229.9 million, or 57%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 201 9 . The increase in revenue was primarily due to expansion within our existing Paid Customers, as reflected by our Net Dollar Retention Rate of 132% as of January 31, 2020, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as our number of Paid Customers increased by 25% in the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. In addition, revenue generated from Paid Customers &gt; $100,000 in the year ended January 31, 2020 increased to 46% compared to 40% in the year ended January 31, 2019. Cost of revenue increased $45.9 million, or 89%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by a $12.4 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, an $8.8 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.9 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth and the continued development and scalability of Slack. Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased $299.8 million, or 190%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $231.1 million increase in stock- 83 based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by a $50.0 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $10.7 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth and the continued development and scalability of Slack. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $169.6 million, or 73%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $101.8 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. Personnel costs, which include customer experience and infrastructure employee costs for users of our free version, increased by $47.7 million related to increased sales and marketing headcount to support our growth. The increase was also driven by a $16.2 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth, a $9.9 million increase in third-party hosting costs for users on a Free subscription plan of Slack due to continuing growth in our user base, and a $6.7 million increase in travel related costs due to increased sales activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of $14.4 million due primarily to reduced spending on advertising by $23.6 million, partially offset by increased public relations, marketing content, and business development programs of $8.7 million, including Frontiers, our annual user conference. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased $148.6 million, or 132%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an $80.9 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by one-time fees of $30.4 million related to financial advisory services, audit, and legal expenses in connection with the Direct Listing, a $23.7 million increase in personnel costs related to increases in our administrative, finance and accounting, legal, IT, and human resources headcount, and a $4.3 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs due to additional headcount. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $0.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019 due primarily to the fees related to the revolving credit facility. Interest Income and Other Income, Net Interest income and other income, net $21.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in interest income and other income, net was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $3.2 million due to overall increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and a net increase in realized and unrealized gains from our strategic investments of $1.9 million, partially offset by a decrease of net foreign exchange gains of $1.3 million. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.3 million from the year ended January 31, 2019, primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from stock-based compensation in our foreign jurisdictions. Quarterly Results of Operations The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended January 31, 2021, as well as the percentage of revenue that each line item represents for each quarter. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all 84 adjustments, which includes only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations that may be expected for any future period. __________________ (1) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: In the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded cumulative stock-based compensation of $245.1 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the performance vesting condition was satisfied upon the completion of the Direct Listing. (2) Our consolidated financial statements include our majority-owned subsidiary, Slack Fund. The ownership interest of minority investors in Slack Fund is recorded as a noncontrolling interest. 85 Quarterly Trends Revenue and Cost of Revenue Our revenue increased sequentially for all periods presented primarily due to higher sales of subscriptions to both our existing and new Paid Customers. We have typically experienced larger billings in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, though this seasonality is sometimes not immediately apparent in our revenue due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract. Total cost of revenue increased sequentially for all periods presented, excluding the impact from stock-based compensation, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and third-party hosting costs necessary to support our growth in revenue. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased sequentially for all periods presented, excluding the impact from the Direct Listing related fees and stock-based compensation, primarily due to increases in employee headcount and the expansion of our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $505.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and U.S. government securities. Restricted cash consists of cash deposited with financial institutions as collateral for our obligations under the facility leases in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado. As of January 31, 2021, our restricted cash totaled $38.5 million. Marketable securities are comprised of certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, U.S. government securities, and corporate bonds. As of January 31, 2021, 95% of all cash and cash equivalents are held in the United States. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock, the Notes, common stock, and cash generated from the sale of our subscriptions. 86 We have generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2021. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments that we intend to make in our business and, as a result, we may require additional capital resources to grow our business. In May 2019, we entered into a $215.0 million revolving credit and guaranty agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The revolving credit facility has an accordion option, which, if exercised, would allow us to increase the aggregate commitments by up to the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA of us and our subsidiaries, plus an unlimited amount subject to satisfaction of certain leverage ratio based compliance tests after giving effect to the exercise, in each case subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we may issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduce the total amount available for borrowing under such facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on May 30, 2024. As of January 31, 2021, we had no amounts or letters of credit issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Our total available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $215.0 million as of January 31, 2021. In April 2020, we completed our private offering of the Notes and received aggregate proceeds of $862.5 million, before deducting issuance costs of $21.2 million. In connection with the Notes, we also entered into the Capped Calls with respect to our Class A common stock. We used an aggregate amount of $105.6 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, our Net Dollar Retention Rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and features, particularly for large organizations and for networks between organizations and the continuing market adoption of Slack. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies and customer acquisition efforts in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.” On December 1, 2020 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Salesforce. We have agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Mergers. Outside of certain limited exceptions, we may not take, authorize, commit, resolve, or agree to do certain actions without Salesforce’s consent, including: • acquiring businesses and disposing of significant assets; • incurring expenditures above specified thresholds; • issuing additional debt facilities; and • repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. 87 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from organizations on a paid subscription plan. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, sales and marketing expenses, and third-party hosting costs. Historically, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities and have supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds from the private sale of equity securities. During the year ended January 31, 2021, operating activities provided $72.4 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $292.5 million, impacted by $323.1 million of non-cash charges and $41.8 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $227.4 million in stock-based compensation, $37.6 million of non-cash lease expenses, $33.7 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, $28.8 million of depreciation and amortization, and $15.8 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, partially offset by a $20.3 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and a $2.2 million gain from net amortization of bond discounts on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $132.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional billings with new and existing paid customers, a $43.7 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, and a $3.2 million increase other liabilities. These amounts were partially offset by a $92.4 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased billings, $25.6 million of operating lease payments, a $16.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $3.4 million decrease in accounts payable. During the year ended January 31, 2020, operating activities used $12.4 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $568.4 million, impacted by $462.8 million of non-cash charges and $93.2 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $426.5 million in stock-based compensation, $27.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $9.0 million of non-cash lease expenses, and $8.2 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, partially offset by a $5.6 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and a $2.2 million gain from net amortization of bond discounts on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $134.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional billings with new and existing paid customers and a $46.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses including compensation and benefits, and accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of our increased spending and headcount associated with the growth of our business. These amounts were partially offset by a $58.2 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased billings, a $20.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and $9.5 million of operating lease payments During the year ended January 31, 2019, operating activities used $41.1 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $138.9 million, impacted by $39.2 million non-cash charges and $58.7 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $23.1 million in stock-based compensation, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.2 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $2.3 million loss on disposal 88 of property and equipment, partially offset by a $3.7 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments and a $3.1 million gain from net amortization of bond discount on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $116.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased billings, and a $45.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses including compensation and benefits, and other liabilities as a result of our increased spending and headcount associated with the growth of our business. These amounts were partially offset by a $53.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to a $22.8 million increase in prepaid hosting services and a $12.7 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $50.3 million increase in accounts receivable, reflecting increased billings. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2021 was $263.1 million, which was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of $561.2 million, strategic investments of $20.0 million , property and equipment o f $10.2 million , an acquisition of intangible assets of $2.4 million , partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $322.9 million and net cash acquired from a business combination o f $6.6 million . Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2020 was $330.1 million, which was primarily driven by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $683.7 million, partially offset by cash used to purchase marketable securities of $290.2 million, property and equipment of $49.6 million, and strategic investments of $14.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2019 was $333.4 million, which was primarily used to purchase marketable securities of $967.1 million, property and equipment of $56.2 million, business and intangible assets of $47.7 million, and strategic investments of $2.3 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $738.9 million. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2021 was $773.0 million, primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $841.3 million, net of issuance costs, proceeds from employee purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of $29.8 million, and the exercise of stock options of $13.1 million, partially offset by a payment for Capped Calls related to the Notes of $105.6 million and payments of contingent consideration for acquisitions of $5.3 million . Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2020 was $18.5 million, primarily driven by the exercise of stock options to purchase common stock of $14.2 million, proceeds from employee purchases of common stock under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, of $7.4 million, and capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $3.8 million, partially offset by a payment of contingent consideration for an acquisition of $5.0 million and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $1.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2019 was $437.7 million, reflecting proceeds from issuance of convertible preferred stock of $426.9 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock to a third party of $6.1 million, and the exercise of stock options to purchase common stock of $4.8 million. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our principal contractual commitments primarily consist of the convertible senior notes and obligations under leases for office space and datacenter operations. 89 The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of January 31, 2021, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: __________________ (1) Consists of principal and interest payments. The $862.5 million in principal is due April 2025. For more information regarding the Notes, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Consists of future non-cancelable minimum lease payments under operating leases for our offices. (3) In April 2020, we executed an amendment to our existing agreement with Amazon Web Services. The amended agreement was effective as of May 1, 2020 and continues through April 30, 2025. We have minimum annual commitments of $75.0 million which will increase by $5.0 million annually, for a total minimum commitment of $425.0 million. (4) Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to IT operations, sales activities and acquisition related obligations. In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, as of January 31, 2021, we had $38.5 million in standby letters of credit outstanding related to our office facilities in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from contracts with organizations on a paid subscription plan using the five-step method described in Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements. We derive substantially all revenue from monthly, annual, and multi-year subscription fees earned from organizations on a paid subscription plan accessing Slack. In our contracts, we typically have one performance obligation of providing access to Slack . On occasion, we also provide professional services to organizations on Slack, which are separate performance obligations. Professional services revenue has not been material to date. In general, we satisfy our performance obligations over time as we provide the promised services to organizations on a paid subscription plan. We maintain a fair billing policy, under which certain organizations on a 90 paid subscription plan are entitled to credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. These credits, accounted for as a part of deferred revenue, may be carried over to offset future billings and are not refundable for cash. A majority of our contracts give a right to bill for additional usage, and this is deemed variable consideration. The variable consideration is allocated to the distinct day the services are completed, as services provided to the additional users are specific to the period that the usage occurs. To the extent that we believe it is probable that a significant reversal would not occur, an estimate is made for the revenue associated with incremental usage during a period. The incremental revenue recognized associated with these estimates has not been material through fiscal year 2021. Convertible Senior Notes The Notes are accounted for in accordance with the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments, such as the Notes, that have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. The carrying amount of the liability component of the instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option using a market-based approach. The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument. The difference between the principal amount and the liability component represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using an effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values. Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. As a result, sales commissions for new revenue contracts, including incremental sales to existing customers, are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit, which we have determined to be generally four years. The period of benefit has been determined by considering factors such as historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of our technology, and the impact of competition in our industry as well as other factors. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, including stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, restricted stock, and purchase rights issued under the ESPP granted to employees, directors, and other service providers, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option and purchase rights issued under the ESPP granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, except for the RSUs granted under our 2009 Stock Plan, or the 2009 Plan. Under the 2009 Plan, we granted RSUs to our employees, directors and service providers with both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting period for these awards was typically four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The fair value of RSUs was estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. On June 20, 2019, the performance vesting condition was satisfied upon the completion of the Direct Listing and as a result, we recorded cumulative stock-based compensation of $245.1 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs granted under the 2009 Plan. We recognize stock compensation associated with the RSUs granted under the 2009 Plan using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period. Under the 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan, we grant RSUs to employees, directors and service providers with a service-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting period for these awards is typically four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. 91 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See the section titled “Description of Business and Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 92","¬Slack is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but at nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks.
Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the year ended January 31, 2021. Further, Slack’s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization’s internally-developed software.
The company generates revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions for Slack. Paid customers typically pay on a monthly or annual basis, based on the number of users that they have on Slack. The company offers four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of organizations on Slack: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. 
The company serves organizations of all sizes across various industries, ranging from software companies to consumer retail companies, financial services companies, and government entities. Slack is currently used in over 150 countries and available in ten languages (English (U.S.), English (U.K.), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin America), and Spanish (Spain)). In the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 39%, 37%, and 36%, respectively, of its revenue was generated outside of the United States.
The company’s go-to-market approach combines a web-based, self-service approach with direct sales efforts that focus on growing users within larger organizations that generally already have Slack users and acquiring new large organizations as paid customers. The company believes that these go-to-market approaches reinforce one another; self-service users often become leads for its direct sales force and users within larger enterprises create organic awareness of Slack inside and outside of their organizations. The company complements these activities with an obsessive focus on customer experience and customer success to support the growth of the number of users on free and paid subscriptions.
The company has experienced rapid growth in recent periods. The company’s revenue was $902.6 million, $630.4 million, and $400.6 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing annual growth of 43% and 57%, respectively. The company generated net losses for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 of $300.4 million, $571.1 million, and $140.7 million, respectively, which included $227.4 million, $426.5 million, and $23.1 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. The company’s net losses excluding the impact from stock-based compensation have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over time as revenue growth has outpaced the growth in operating expenses.

On December 1, 2020, the company entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub I with and into Slack, with Slack continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce, or the First Merger, immediately followed by a second merger of the surviving corporation into either Merger Sub II or Salesforce, or the Second Merger, with either Merger Sub II or Salesforce continuing as the surviving company.
The company reviews the following key business metrics to measure its performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The company focuses on growing the number of Paid Customers >$100,000 as a measure of its ability to scale with organizations on Slack and attract larger organizations to Slack. The company believes that its ability to increase the number of Paid Customers >$100,000 is a key indicator for important components of the growth of its business, including its success in expanding the number of users within a Paid Customer, providing the functionality required by large organizations and developing the company’s direct sales force. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 49%, 46%, and 40%, respectively, of the company’s revenue was generated from its Paid Customers >$100,000. The company defines Paid Customers >$100,000 as those organizations on a paid subscription plan that had more than $100,000 in ARR as of a period end. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is reconciled on a monthly or quarterly basis based on usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of active subscriptions as of the month end. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is fixed and independent of usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of purchased subscriptions.
The company discloses Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of its organic revenue growth. The company believes Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of its subscription agreements and the company’s ability to retain, and grow revenue from, its Paid Customers.
The company calculates Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. The company then calculates the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR.
Revenue increased $272.2 million, or 43%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in revenue was primarily due to expansion within the company’s existing Paid Customers, as reflected by its Net Dollar Retention Rate of 123% as of January 31, 2021, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as the company’s number of Paid Customers increased by 42% in the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, revenue generated from Paid Customers > $100,000 in the year ended January 31, 2021 increased to 49% compared to 46% in the year ended January 31, 2020.
Cost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 25%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an $18.0 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, a $9.9 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.0 million increase in credit card payment processing fees as the volume of sales transactions increased. These increases were partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019
Interest expense increased by $37.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 due to contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the Notes issued in April 2020.
As of January 31, 2021, the company’s principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $505.9 million. The company has generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past as reflected in its accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2021. The company expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments that the company intends to make in the company’s business and, as a result, the company may require additional capital resources to grow its business.
In May 2019, the company entered into a $215.0 million revolving credit and guaranty agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The revolving credit facility has an accordion option, which, if exercised, would allow us to increase the aggregate commitments by up to the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA, plus an unlimited amount subject to satisfaction of certain leverage ratio based compliance tests after giving effect to the exercise, in each case subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain conditions. The company total available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $215.0 million as of January 31, 2021.
In April 2020, the company completed its private offering of the Notes and received aggregate proceeds of $862.5 million, before deducting issuance costs of $21.2 million. In connection with the Notes, the company also entered into the Capped Calls with respect to its Class A common stock. The company used an aggregate amount of $105.6 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls.
During the year ended January 31, 2021, operating activities provided $72.4 million in cash. The primary factors affecting the company’s operating cash flows during this period were the company's net loss of $292.5 million, impacted by $323.1 million of non-cash charges and $41.8 million of cash provided from changes in its operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $227.4 million in stock-based compensation, $37.6 million of non-cash lease expenses, $33.7 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, $28.8 million of depreciation and amortization, and $15.8 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, partially offset by a $20.3 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of its strategic investments, and a $2.2 million gain from net amortization of bond discounts on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in the company’s operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $132.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional billings with new and existing paid customers, a $43.7 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, and a $3.2 million increase other liabilities. These amounts were partially offset by a $92.4 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased billings, $25.6 million of operating lease payments, a $16.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $3.4 million decrease in accounts payable.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2021 was $263.1 million, which was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of $561.2 million, strategic investments of $20.0 million, property and equipment of $10.2 million, an acquisition of intangible assets of $2.4 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $322.9 million and net cash acquired from a business combination of $6.6 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2021 was $773.0 million, primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $841.3 million, net of issuance costs, proceeds from employee purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of $29.8 million, and the exercise of stock options of $13.1 million, partially offset by a payment for Capped Calls related to the Notes of $105.6 million and payments of contingent consideration for acquisitions of $5.3 million.

"The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements. Business Overview We enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of ICs, SoCs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP. Our strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design™, is to provide the technology necessary for our customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA. We group our products into categories related to major design activities: • Custom IC Design and Simulation; • Digital IC Design and Signoff; • Functional Verification; • IP; and • System Design and Analysis. For additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Products and Product Strategy.” During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed our acquisitions of AWR and Integrand. The aggregate cash consideration for these acquisitions of approximately $196 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions enhance our technology portfolio to address growing radio frequency design activity, driven by expanding use of 5G communications. These acquisitions increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, more than revenue during fiscal 2020. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Belgium-based NUMECA, a leader in CFD, mesh generation, multi-physics simulation and optimization. The addition of NUMECA’s technologies and talent supports our Intelligent System Design™ strategy. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” COVID-19 Impact In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures. Our compliance with these containment measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of February 22, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some volatility in our usual delivery timing for our hardware and IP products to certain customers. Many of our customers' employees are working remotely, and, in some cases, we have experienced delivery lead times that are longer than normal because of delays in getting access to customer sites to complete our deliveries. In other cases, the amount of our hardware and IP products that we have been able to deliver has been greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the respective period. We have also received numerous COVID-19 pandemic-related requests from our customers to allow them to delay their payments to us, while we continue to provide services to these customers. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has posed to our operations, it did not have material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows during fiscal 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information on the impact of COVID-19. 29 Results of Operations The discussion of our fiscal 2020 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2019 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. For a discussion of the fiscal 2019 changes compared to fiscal 2018, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, filed on February 24, 2020. Our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, compared to 2019 and 2018, which were each 52-week fiscal years. The additional week in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional revenue of approximately $45 million and additional expense, including stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles, of approximately $35 million. Results of operations for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflect the following: • increased product and maintenance revenue, resulting from growth in software, IP and hardware, particularly in China and the United States; • higher selling costs, including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements; • continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio; • decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain COVID-19; • a 3 percentage point increase in operating margin driven primarily by revenue growth and temporary decreases in certain operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and • changes in our provision (benefit) for income taxes due to a non-cash tax benefit resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary during fiscal 2019. Revenue We primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery. In any fiscal year, we expect that between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue will be characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements. The remainder of our revenue is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period. Revenue by Year The following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019 and the change in revenue between years: Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and IP performance obligations. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2020 or 2019. 30 Revenue by Product Category The following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2020 and 2019: Revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services, our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them. Certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. The actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. Revenue by Geography Revenue in the United States increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in revenue for software and IP offerings. Revenue in China increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019,due to increased demand from many of our customers in China. We experienced an increase in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 13% of our total revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 11% during the first half of fiscal 2019. This was followed by an additional increase in demand in the second half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 17% of our revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 10% during the second half of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2021, we expect revenue from our customers in China to be consistent, as a percentage of total revenue, with the first half of fiscal 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not been able to deliver maintenance or support for certain customers in China due to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s designation of these customers to the “Entity List.” We expect these restrictions and new or expanded trade restrictions to continue to impact revenue from certain customers in China. For the primary factors contributing to the change in revenue for other geographies during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, see the general description under “Revenue by Year” and “Revenue by Product Category” above. 31 Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.” Cost of Revenue The following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Cost of Product and Maintenance Cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and IP products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or IP. A summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is as follows: 32 Product and maintenance-related costs increased during fiscal 2020, when compared to fiscal 2019, due to the following: Costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. These costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products. The increase in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to increased demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware, increased reserves for inventory, and the mix of products generating revenue. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased by $9.4 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to technology-related intangible assets acquired from AWR and Integrand during fiscal 2020 and in-process technology being placed into service during fiscal 2020 and 2019. This increase was partially offset by certain technology-related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019. Cost of Services Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. Cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects. Despite an increase in services revenue, cost of services decreased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to a higher margin on the mix of services arrangements in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, and temporary savings due to the COVID pandemic. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, stock-based compensation, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results. During fiscal 2020 we experienced decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain COVID-19. Many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. We recognize lower expenses in periods when the United States dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the United States dollar weakens against other currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Risk.” Our operating expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Our operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: 33 Marketing and Sales The changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following: Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales expense increased due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to invest in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements. This increase was partially offset by reduced costs for marketing events and travel due to COVID-19. Research and Development The changes in research and development expense were due to the following: Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio. This increase was partially offset by reduced costs for travel due to COVID-19. General and Administrative The changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following: Salary, benefits and other employee-related costs included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and additional headcount from hiring. 34 Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Amortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks and patents. Amortization in any given period depends primarily the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased by $7.3 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to intangibles assets acquired from AWR and Integrand during fiscal 2020. This increase was partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019. Restructuring and Other Charges We have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. The following table presents restructuring and other charges, net for our restructuring plans: For an additional description of our restructuring plans, see Note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Operating margin Operating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows: Operating margin increased during fiscal, 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, because revenue growth exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses. During fiscal 2021, we expect growth in operating margin will be more moderate due to an increase in costs and expenses associated with acquisitions, including increased amortization of intangibles. We also expect an increase in expenses related to travel, meetings and events if measures implemented to contain COVID-19 are lifted. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was comprised of the following: Interest expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to borrowings of $350 million under our revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty. All outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For an additional description of our debt arrangements, including our revolving credit facility, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 35 Income Taxes The following table presents the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019: In June 2020, the State of California enacted legislation that, for a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2020, will limit our utilization of California research and development tax credits to $5 million annually and will suspend the use of California net operating loss deductions. We accounted for the effects of the California tax law change and we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $22.2 million due to a partial release of the valuation allowance on our California research and development tax credit deferred tax assets as a result of certain tax elections made in our 2019 California tax return. Our provision for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2020 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our California research and development tax credit deferred tax assets and the tax benefit of $60.1 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a net deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. We expected to realize the deferred tax asset in future periods and did not provide for a valuation allowance. This income tax benefit was partially offset by the federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2019 income. We also recognized $36.8 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the United States federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. A significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. We currently expect that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be approximately 14%. We expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. For additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For further discussion regarding our income taxes, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents As of January 2, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $928.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $705.2 million as of December 28, 2019. Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments on our revolving credit facility, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property, plant and equipment. 36 Approximately 61% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months. Net Working Capital Net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in our net working capital as of January 2, 2021, as compared to December 28, 2019, is primarily due to improved results from operations, the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. We expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows: The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements, partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock. 37 Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources Stock Repurchase Program At the end of fiscal 2019, approximately $369 million remained available under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock. In July 2020, Cadence’s Board of Directors increased the previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of Cadence common stock by an additional $750 million. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. As of January 2, 2021, approximately $739 million remained available to repurchase shares of Cadence common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information. Revolving Credit Facility Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of January 2, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility. 2024 Notes In October 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. We received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. As of January 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes. For additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2021 is as follows: _________________ (1) This table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of January 2, 2021 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of January 2, 2021. (2) Included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $17.6 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. Of the $17.6 million, we estimate $16.3 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years, $1.2 million within 3 to 5 years and $0.1 million in more than 5 years. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 2, 2021, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 38 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or IP licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. These contracts require us to apply judgement in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of our IP license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. Our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”) for each distinct performance obligation. We rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the SSP. Revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. For our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. For our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term. If a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. We exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. Our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved. We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations. 39 We only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2019, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our Irish subsidiary, which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $575.6 million. To determine the value of the deferred tax asset, we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred IP rights. These estimates included, but are not limited to, the income and cash flows that the IP rights are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections, and the useful lives of the IP rights. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, it would impact the fair value of the IP rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized. In addition, we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50% likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income. We give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is greater than 50% likely that the deferred tax asset of $575.6 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required. If, in the future, we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized, an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such a determination is made. Business Combinations When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities. We also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we acquired intangible assets of $101.3 million with our acquisition of AWR and Integrand. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired with these acquisitions was determined using variations of the income approach. For existing technology, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. To estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of technological obsolescence which was estimated at rate between 5% and 7.5% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 20%. The present value of after-tax royalty savings were determined using discount rates ranging from 10% to 11.5%. The fair value for customer contracts and related relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging between 85% and 95%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customer was determined using discount rates 10% and 11.5%. 40 We also assumed obligations related to deferred revenue of $6.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with our acquisition of AWR. The fair value of these obligations was estimated using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value using estimates of the costs required to fulfill the contracted obligations plus an assumed profit margin, which approximates the amount that AWR would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation. Cadence believes that its estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved. New Accounting Standards For additional information about the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. 41","The company enables its customers to develop electronic products. The company’s products and services are designed to give its customers a competitive edge in their development of ICs, SoCs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. The company’s products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring its customers’ products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. The company offers software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as IP.
The company’s strategy, which it calls Intelligent System Design™, is to provide the technology necessary for its customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. The company’s products and services enable its customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for its technology is driven by the company’s customers’ investment in new designs and products. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as EDA. Today, the company’s offerings include and extend beyond EDA.
The company groups its products into categories related to major design activities:
•Custom IC Design and Simulation;
•Digital IC Design and Signoff;
•Functional Verification;
•IP; and
•System Design and Analysis.
Results of operations for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflect the following:
•increased product and maintenance revenue, resulting from growth in software, IP and hardware, particularly in China and the United States;
•higher selling costs, including additional investment in technical sales support in response to the company's customers’ increasing technological requirements;
•continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing the company's product portfolio;
•decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain COVID-19;
•a 3 percentage point increase in operating margin driven primarily by revenue growth and temporary decreases in certain operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•changes in the company's provision (benefit) for income taxes due to a non-cash tax benefit resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to the company's Irish subsidiary during fiscal 2019.
The company primarily generates revenue from licensing its software and IP, selling or leasing its emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for its software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of its IP. The timing of the company’s revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.
Product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily because of increased investments by the company’s customers in new, complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. Services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of its services and IP performance obligations.
No one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2020 or 2019.

Revenue in the United States increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in revenue for software and IP offerings.
Revenue in China increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to increased demand from many of the company's customers in China. The company experienced an increase in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 13% of its total revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 11% during the first half of fiscal 2019. This was followed by an additional increase in demand in the second half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 17% of the company's revenue being generated from customers in China, as compared to approximately 10% during the second half of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2021, the company expect revenue from its customers in China to be consistent, as a percentage of total revenue, with the first half of fiscal 2020.
Most of the company’s revenue is transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. For an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect the company's consolidated financial statements.
Cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of the company’s emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of its software and IP products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of the company's customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on the company’s hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which the company acquires intangible assets, license third-party technology or IP, and sell the company's products that include such acquired or licensed technology or IP.
Operating margin increased during fiscal, 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, because revenue growth exceeded the growth of the company's costs and expenses. During fiscal 2021, the company expects growth in operating margin will be more moderate due to an increase in costs and expenses associated with acquisitions, including increased amortization of intangibles. The company also expects an increase in expenses related to travel, meetings and events if measures implemented to contain COVID-19 are lifted.
Interest expense increased during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to borrowings of $350 million under the company's revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty. All outstanding borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For an additional description of the company's debt arrangements, including the company's revolving credit facility.

As of January 2, 2021, the company’s principal sources of liquidity consisted of $928.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $705.2 million as of December 28, 2019.
The company’s primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under the company's employee stock purchase plan.
The company’s primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of the company's common stock, payments on the company's revolving credit facility, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property, plant and equipment.  Approximately 61% of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by its foreign subsidiaries as of January 2, 2021.
Net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on the company's consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the company’s net working capital as of January 2, 2021, as compared to December 28, 2019, is primarily due to improved results from operations, the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
Cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. The company’s cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in the company's customer agreements. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. The company expects to continue the company's investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.
The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements, partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of the company's common stock.

The company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. The credit facility expires on January 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. Any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on January 28, 2022. Outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. As of January 2, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, and the companywas in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.
In October 2014, the company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due October 15, 2024. The company received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of the company's existing and future senior indebtedness. As of January 2, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 Notes.

"The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 29, 2019, filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020. ACQUISITIONS Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $106 million in cash consideration, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for approximately $1.64 billion, and integrated them into our Digital Experience reportable segment. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own. Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in 42 real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers; • the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; • the expected use of the acquired assets; and • discount rates. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules, and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) which resulted in the establishment of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $ 224 million and $ 1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. The sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of the valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities. 43 Recent Accounting Pronouncements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2020 For our fiscal 2020, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media offerings consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans with respect to this segment. In our Digital Experience segment, we continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we began to discontinue our transaction-driven Advertising Cloud offerings, allowing us to focus our investment on strategic growth initiatives. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined Advertising Cloud with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. Digital Media In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers. We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users as a result of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business. We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses. 44 Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and remaining performance obligation as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows: Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $8.72 billion, up from $7.25 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the ARR reported above. Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2020 was $7.74 billion, up from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 19% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2020 was $1.50 billion, up from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth and reflecting an increase in demand driven by the shift to remote work as well as our continued efforts to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 20% year-over-year growth. These increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement. Digital Experience We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions. Adobe Experience Cloud is focused on delivering solutions for our enterprise customers across the following strategic growth pillars: • Customer data and insights. Our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, Real-time Customer Data Platform and Intelligent Services. • Content and commerce. Our solutions to help customers manage, deliver, test, target and optimize content delivery and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Commerce. • Customer journey management. Our solutions help businesses manage, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases. Our offerings include Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and Journey Orchestration. In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business 45 with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. Digital Experience revenue for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect the Advertising Cloud segment move. Digital Experience revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019 which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020 from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2019, representing 17% year-over-year growth. COVID-19 UPDATE In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. As a result, we have taken action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as Adobe Summit and MAX, with digital events through July 2021. During the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This macro trend towards all things digital has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business, which contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2020 • Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $10.18 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of November 29, 2019.

Presentation Changes In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. Further, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Financial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect these reclassifications. There were no other updates to disclosures included in our prior year report in relation to the reclassifications. Revenue Our financial results for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results have not been restated which limits its comparability with other fiscal years presented. Subscription Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services. We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are recognized on a usage basis. We have the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. Subscription revenue by reportable segment for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: _________________________________________ (*) Percentage is less than 1%. Product Our product revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to licenses for on-premise software purchased on a perpetual basis, for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. We primarily recognize 47 product revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Services and Other Our services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers. Segments In fiscal 2020, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments: • Digital Media —Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

Segment Information Digital Media Revenue from Digital Media increased $1.53 billion during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, driven by increases in revenue associated with our Creative and Document Cloud offerings due to increased demand and digital engagement amid the work-from-home environment. Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in net new subscriptions across our Creative Cloud offerings. Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue driven by strong adoption of our Document Cloud offerings including Adobe Sign. 48 Digital Experience Revenue from Digital Experience increased $330 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings of which the largest contributors were our AEM and Marketo Engage offerings. Geographical Information Overall revenue during fiscal 2020 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in Digital Media revenue and, to a lesser extent, increases in Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our cash flow hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. Dollar strengthened largely against EMEA currencies and the Australian Dollar, which decreased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The foreign currency impact to revenue was partially offset by gains primarily from our Euro cash flow hedging program. 49 Cost of Revenue _________________________________________ (*) Percentage is less than 1% Subscription Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party hosting services and data center costs, royalty fees and other expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. Cost of subscription revenue increased due to the following: Product Cost of product revenue is primarily comprised of third-party royalties, amortization related to purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology, excess and obsolete inventory, localization costs and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Services and Other Cost of services and other revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related and other associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and other also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory sources for our transaction-based Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings, which we began to discontinue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Cost of services and other fluctuations were due to the following: 50 Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, third party fees for hosting services, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses increased due to the following: We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our subscription and service offerings, applications and tools. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, amortization of contract acquisition costs, including sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and events, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased due to the following: 51 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. General and administrative expenses increased due to the following: During fiscal 2020, we recorded net charges related to the cancellation of our corporate events due to concerns over the pandemic. Certain of these charges were reversed as we successfully negotiated the right to apply certain commitments to other events. Bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to specific reserves for certain categories of customers that were more impacted by the changes in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the pandemic. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization expense decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to certain intangible assets from previous acquisitions, including from Marketo and Omniture, becoming fully amortized during the year. Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net _________________________________________ (*) Percentage is less than 1%. (**) Percentage is not meaningful. Interest Expense Interest expense represents interest associated with our debt instruments. Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Interest on our Term Loan, which was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, was payable periodically at the end of each interest period. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps, which matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, were paid monthly and the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps was received semi-annually concurrent with the Notes interest payments. Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt instruments that were refinanced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 52 Investment Gains (Losses), Net Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. Investment gains (losses), net decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the gain recognized upon our acquisition of the remaining interest in Allegorithmic in January 2019. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense), remained stable during fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in interest income driven by lower average interest rates offset by our change in methodology of accounting for foreign currency cash flow hedges. Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, option premiums, which were previously recorded in other income (expense), net, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes _________________________________________ (**) Percentage is not meaningful. Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 34 percentage points during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. The change is primarily due to non-recurring tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) completed during fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights, a favorable geographic mix of earnings and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit. In years beyond fiscal 2020, the change in the geographic mix of international income resulting from these transfers is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rates and cash flows. However, the adverse impact to effective rates for cash paid for income taxes will be partially offset by future deductions on the transferred IP rights. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Act was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us. Certain international provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax and a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, took effect in fiscal 2019. As the U.S. Treasury releases regulations that impact these provisions, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $276 million as of November 27, 2020 and is primarily attributable to certain state and foreign credits and foreign intangible assets. 53 We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The current U.S. tax law provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. In June 2020, California enacted legislation which includes a limitation on the utilization of research and development tax credits for a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021. The net impact of the legislation is uncertain but is anticipated to increase our California tax and, consequently, adversely impact our effective tax rates for the three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $201 million, $173 million and $196 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2020, November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 were recognized, $136 million, $116 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates. The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $26 million and $25 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20 million over the next 12 months. In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. 54 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working Capital Working capital as of November 27, 2020 and November 29, 2019 was $2.63 billion of a surplus and $1.70 billion of a deficit, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced our 2.25 billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”). See the section titled “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. A summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $5.73 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income together with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables, which were offset in part by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services, and the decrease in trade receivables was largely attributable to strong collections. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by sales commissions paid and capitalized and, to a lesser extent, increases due to the timing of billings and payments associated with certain vendors. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For fiscal 2020, net cash used for investing activities of $414 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For fiscal 2020, net cash used for financing activities of $3.49 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below. In February 2020, we issued $500 million of 1.70% senior notes due February 1, 2023 (“2023 Notes”), $500 million of 1.90% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (“1.90% 2025 Notes”), $850 million of 2.15% senior notes due February 1, 2027 (“2027 Notes”) and $1.30 billion of 2.30% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). We used the proceeds to repay the Term Loan and 2020 Notes concurrently. 55 Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2021 due to changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” While the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 27, 2020 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities and time deposits. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 27, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 27, 2020, we have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of the 2023 Notes, 1.90% 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and the $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “3.25% 2025 Notes,” and together with the aforementioned notes, the “Notes”). The Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. As of November 27, 2020, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $550 million to $650 million, primarily to fund our San Jose and Bangalore construction projects through fiscal 2022. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition . Stock Repurchase Program To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $3.05 billion, $2.75 billion, and $2.05 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is expected to be higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. 56 The following is a summary of our structured stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2020, November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2020, $255 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $950 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $950 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.1 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. Further, in December 2020, our Board of Directors granted us additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2024. We have not drawn from our new $15 billion authority as of the issuance of these financial statements. November 27, 2020 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 27, 2020 consist of our Notes and obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 27, 2020: Senior Notes As of November 27, 2020, the carrying value of our Notes was $4.12 billion. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 27, 2020, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $613 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding Notes. Covenants Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 27, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 57 Transition Taxes Liability Our transition tax liability which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act was approximately $390 million as of November 27, 2020 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The U.S. Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes See above and for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.","Subsequent to November 27, 2020, the company completed its acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. Workfront will be integrated into the company's Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
During fiscal 2019, the company acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $106 million in cash consideration, and integrated it into the company's Digital Media reportable segment.
During fiscal 2018, the company completed its acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for approximately $1.64 billion, and integrated them into the company’s Digital Experience reportable segment.
For the company’s fiscal 2020, it experienced strong demand across its Digital Media offerings consistent with the continued execution of the company's long-term plans with respect to this segment. In the company’s Digital Experience segment, the company continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across its portfolio of offerings.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the company began to discontinue its transaction-driven Advertising Cloud offerings, allowing the company to focus its investment on strategic growth initiatives.
Digital Media
In the company's Digital Media segment, the company are a market leader with Creative Cloud, the company’s subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric the company's management uses to assess the health and trajectory of the company's overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and remaining performance obligation as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items.
Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $8.72 billion, up from $7.25 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Revaluing the company's ending ARR for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, the company's Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the ARR reported above.
The company is a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by its Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. The company's differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by the company's ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect the company's comprehensive set of solutions.
•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $10.18 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of November 29, 2019. The increase in the company's Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of the company's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.
•Creative revenue of $7.74 billion increased by $1.25 billion, or 19%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019. Document Cloud revenue of $1.50 billion increased by $272 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with the company's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.
•Digital Experience revenue of $3.13 billion increased by $330 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2020, from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across the company's offerings.
•Remaining performance obligation of $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.52 billion, or 15%, from $9.82 billion as of November 29, 2019, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for the company's Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings.
•Cost of revenue of $1.72 billion increased by $49 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.67 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, offset in large part by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.
•Operating expenses of $6.91 billion increased by $679 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend. These increases were offset in part by decreases in travel-related expenses.
•Net income of $5.26 billion increased by $2.31 billion, or 78%, during fiscal 2020 from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in revenue and the non-recurring benefit from income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights.
•Net cash flows from operations of $5.73 billion during fiscal 2020 increased by $1.31 billion, or 30%, from $4.42 billion during fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items.
Working capital as of November 27, 2020 and November 29, 2019 was $2.63 billion of a surplus and $1.70 billion of a deficit, respectively.

Our service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, fees for processing services that we provide to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions to us, and professional services primarily for software customizations provided to both license and processing customers. Our results vary in part depending on the size and number of software licenses recognized as well as the value and number of professional services contracts recognized in a particular period. As we continue to grow our Processing Services business, we continue to gain economies of scale on the investment we have made in the infrastructure, resources, processes and software features developed over the past number of years to support this growing side of our business. We are adding new processing customers at a faster pace than we are adding new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. However, we are also experiencing growth in revenue from license customers due to the addition of a large new customer in 2018, referred to as “Customer A” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In total, this customer represented 69 percent and 60 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance and license revenue from this customer in 2021 and future years; however, the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer. License revenue from this customer, similar to other license arrangements, is tiered based on the number of active accounts on the system. Once the customer achieves each tier level, they receive a perpetual license up to that number of accounts; inactive accounts do not count toward the license tier. The customer receives an unlimited perpetual license at a maximum tier level that allows them to utilize the software for any number of active accounts. They currently use the software for a single institution and additional license fees apply if multiple institutions are added. Support and maintenance fees are charged based on the tier level achieved and increase at new tier levels. During 2020, we experienced the loss of a large customer due to insolvency, referred to as “Customer B” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognized revenue of $845,000 and $3,700,000 from this customer for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of approximately $2,855,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. We opened offices in Dubai and Chennai and hired some of the insolvent company’s employees and are in the process of converting some of their customers to our processing platform. We expect revenue in 2021 and future years from servicing these customers and adding new customers in the region. We typically receive revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown has had a muted impact on our results. Most of our employees in India have been working remotely throughout the pandemic which has impacted our ability to hire and train new employees. We have been able to maintain key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in our professional services revenue; however, the hiring and training constraints could impact future growth in our professional services revenue. The infrastructure of our multi customer environment is scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to personnel, including more than 500 employees located in India and Romania. In 2017, we opened a second office in India, located near Mumbai, to enable us to attract the level of talent required for our software development and testing. In October 2020, we opened offices in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Chennai, India to support CoreCard’s expansion of processing services into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. The new offices include engineering, support and business professionals with significant payments industry experience and experience operating CoreCard’s Processing platforms in the related regions. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes and software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, we have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results. 6 Our revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods. It is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly basis for various reasons, including the following: We continue to maintain a strong cash position. We intend to use cash balances to support the domestic and international operations associated with our CoreCard business and to expand our operations in the FinTech industry through financing the growth of CoreCard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. Additionally, in November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million. We made $1.6 million in share repurchases in 2020, and no share repurchases were made in 2019. Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report. Revenue – Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $35,873,000 which represents a 5 percent increase over 2019. Cost of Revenue – Total cost of revenue was 43 percent of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 34 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by investments made in our processing infrastructure including hardware and software purchases and additional space in our data centers. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual maintenance and support services to our installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services and costs to provide our financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from period to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and offshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided. In addition, we continue to devote the resources necessary to support our growing processing business, including direct costs for regulatory compliance, infrastructure, network certifications and customer support. We made significant investments in our processing infrastructure in 2020 in anticipation of adding new processing customers in 2021 and future years. These increased costs, primarily depreciation of new hardware and additional data center space, negatively impacted our margins in 2020 and will continue to do so until we add additional customers. However, we do expect future economies of scale in our processing environment. This may be subject to change in the future if new regulations or processing standards are implemented causing us to incur additional costs to comply. 7 Operating Expenses – For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were slightly lower as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 primarily due to lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses were lower mainly due to lower recognition-based bonus accruals, partially offset by higher payroll and related expense for additional offshore technical personnel. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher stock compensation and salaries expenses due to the new 2020 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan and an increase in headcount, respectively, partially offset by strategic initiatives of the Board in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. Marketing expenses decreased in 2020 as we continued to place less focus on marketing initiatives for CoreCard. Our client base increased in 2020 and 2019 with minimal marketing efforts as we continue to have prospects contact us via online searches; however, we will continue to re-evaluate our marketing expenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business. Investment I ncome (Loss) – Investment Income (Loss) was a loss of $1,044,000 in 2020 and income of $34,000 in 2019. In 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,009,000 on investments resulting from the economic downturn caused by the recent pandemic. Other Income, net – Other Income, net was $378,000 in 2020 and $99,000 in 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash and note receivable balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes – We recorded $2,468,000 in 2020 for income tax expense, an effective tax rate of 23.2%, compared to tax expense of $2,546,000 in 2019, an effective tax rate of 18.8%. The 2019 period benefited from an excess tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options. We expect our future effective tax rate to be within the range of 22-24%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $37,956,000 compared to $26,415,000 at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operations was $20,966,000 compared to cash provided by operations of $10,585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to lower accounts receivable, an increase in cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation and non-cash investment losses. These increases were partially offset by lower net income and lower accrued payroll. We used $6,875,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software primarily to enhance our existing processing environment in the U.S. as well for computer equipment for the technical resources added in our India office during 2020. We do not expect to pay any regular or special dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand as well as projected customer payments to support our operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. Currently we expect to use cash in excess of what is required for our current operations for opportunities we believe will expand our FinTech business, as exemplified in transactions described in Notes 3 and 5, although there can be no assurance that appropriate opportunities will arise. Additionally, in November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million. We made share repurchases of $1.6 million in 2020, and we did not make any share repurchases in 2019. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 8 Revenue Recognition – Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; professional services for software customization, consulting, and training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer support. Our software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories: At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our performance obligations, we consider all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition policies for each of the situations described above are discussed below. Our software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional intellectual property. Additionally, the purpose in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to use our intellectual property. Our software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Initial implementation fees do not meet the criteria for separate accounting because the software usually requires significant modification or customization that is essential to its functionality. We recognize revenue related to implementations over the life of the customer once the implementation is complete. We account for the PCS element contained in the initial contract based on relative standalone selling price, which is annual renewal fees for such services, and PCS is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the contract as we generally satisfy these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance. Upon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the PCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and support contracts and renew such contracts annually. Certain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, and related recognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future performance obligations are identified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance obligation, we have recognized revenue at the time the individual performance obligation was completed. Purchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period in which the purchase is made for perpetual licenses or ratably over the remaining contract term for non-perpetual licenses. Services provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract are single element services contracts. These standalone services contracts are not essential to the functionality of the software contained in the initial contract and generally do not include acceptance clauses or refund rights as may be included in the initial software contracts, as described above. Revenues from these services contracts, which are generally performed within a relatively short period of time, are recognized when the services are complete or in some cases as the services are provided. These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed. Payment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee with the remainder due upon completion or on a time and materials basis. 9 For contracts for licensed software which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for software usage, maintenance and support, we recognize the total fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue. Revenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, number of accounts on the system, number of hours of services or computer resources used. For processing services which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for services, we recognize the initial fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. For processing services revenues, we stand ready to provide continuous access to our processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. We typically satisfy our processing services performance obligations over time as the services are provided. Technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our products or service offerings. We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party. We determine whether we are responsible for providing the actual product or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether we have control of the product or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level. Indicators that we consider in determining if we have control include whether we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified product or service to the customer, whether we have inventory risk and discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the product or service. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained. Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales tax. Deferred revenue consists of advance payments by software customers for annual or quarterly PCS, advance payments from customers for software licenses and professional services not yet delivered, and initial implementation payments for processing services or bundled license and support services in multi-year contracts. Deferred revenue is classified as long-term until such time that it becomes likely that the services or products will be provided within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Valuation of Investments – We hold minority interests in non-publicly traded companies whose values are not readily determinable and are based on management’s estimate of realizability of the value of the investment. Future adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results, lack of progress of the investee company or its inability to raise capital to support its business plan could result in investment losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment. Our policy with respect to minority interests is to record an impairment charge when we conclude an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. At least quarterly, we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying value and we write-down any impaired asset at quarter-end to our best estimate of its current realizable value. We have an equity investment and various loans with a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry. A portion of the company’s business has been negatively impacted by the pandemic while other portions of its business have improved. We evaluate on a continuing basis whether any impairment indicators are present that would require additional analysis or write-downs of the investment. While we have not recorded an impairment related to this investment or determined that an impairment trigger existed at December 31, 2020, significant variations from current expectations could impact future assessments resulting in future impairment charges. We also have an investment with a privately held technology company and program manager in the FinTech industry. In the first quarter of 2020, due to the economic downturn resulting from the recent pandemic, we recorded an impairment charge of $750,000 to reduce the carrying value of the investee company to $0. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 10 Factors That May Affect Future Operations Future operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future results of operations or projected cash requirements. It is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with certainty. Among the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following: R ecent Accounting Pronouncements – Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.","Intelligent Systems Corporation (“ISC”)

ISC’s consolidated operations consist of its CoreCard Software subsidiary and its affiliate companies in Romania, India and Dubai, as well as a corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support to CoreCard.

The company provides technology solutions and processing services to the financial services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. ISC derives its product revenue from licensing its comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, loyalty programs, and accounts receivable and loan transactions. The company’s service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, fees for processing services that it provides to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions to ISC, and professional services primarily for software customizations provided to both license and processing customers.

During 2020, ISC experienced the loss of a large customer due to insolvency, referred to as “Customer B” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The company recognized revenue of $845,000 and $3,700,000 from this customer for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of approximately $2,855,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. ISC opened offices in Dubai and Chennai and hired some of the insolvent company’s employees and is in the process of converting some of their customers to ISC’s processing platform.

ISC typically receives revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown has had a muted impact on its results. Most of the company’s employees in India have been working remotely throughout the pandemic which has impacted ISC’s ability to hire and train new employees. The company has been able to maintain key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in its professional services revenue; however, the hiring and training constraints could impact future growth in its professional services revenue.

Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $35,873,000 which represents a 5 percent increase over 2019. Revenue from services was $32,273,000 in 2020, which represents a 13 percent increase from 2019 revenue of $28,578,000. Revenue from transaction processing services, software maintenance and support services, and professional services were greater in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file and an increase in the number and value of professional services contracts completed in 2020. Revenue from products, which includes software license fees was $3,600,000 in 2020, compared to $5,725,000 in 2019. The decrease results from fewer customers achieving new license tiers in 2020 than in 2019.

Total cost of revenue was 43 percent of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 34 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by investments made in the company’s processing infrastructure including hardware and software purchases and additional space in its data centers. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual maintenance and support services to ISC’s installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services and costs to provide its financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from period to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and offshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were slightly lower as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 primarily due to lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Marketing expenses decreased in 2020 as the company continued to place less focus on marketing initiatives for CoreCard. ISC’s client base increased in 2020 and 2019 with minimal marketing efforts as the company continues to have prospects contact it via online searches; however, ISC will continue to re-evaluate its marketing expenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business.

The company’s cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $37,956,000 compared to $26,415,000 at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operations was $20,966,000 compared to cash provided by operations of $10,585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to lower accounts receivable, an increase in cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation and non-cash investment losses. These increases were partially offset by lower net income and lower accrued payroll.

ISC used $6,875,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software primarily to enhance its existing processing environment in the U.S. as well for computer equipment for the technical resources added in ISC’s India office during 2020.

The company does not expect to pay any regular or special dividends in the foreseeable future. ISC expects to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand as well as projected customer payments to support its operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. Currently the company expects to use cash in excess of what is required for its current operations for opportunities it believes will expand the company’s FinTech business. Additionally, in November 2018, ISC’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million. ISC made share repurchases of $1.6 million in 2020, and it did not make any share repurchases in 2019.

"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Please see the sections entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and ""Risk Factors"" above for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Overview SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology, or IT, infrastructure management software. Our products give organizations worldwide, regardless of type, size or IT infrastructure complexity, the power to monitor and manage the performance of their IT environments, whether on-premises in the cloud, or in hybrid models. We combine powerful, scalable, affordable, easy to use products with a high-velocity, low-touch sales model to grow our business while also generating significant cash flow. We offer a broad portfolio of infrastructure location-agnostic products to monitor and manage network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures and IT service desks. We intend to continue to innovate and invest in areas of product development that bring new products to market and enhance the functionality, ease of use and integration of our current products. We believe this will strengthen the overall value proposition of our products in any IT environment. Cyber Incident On December 14, 2020, we announced that we had been the victim of a cyberattack on our Orion Software Platform and internal systems, or the “Cyber Incident.” Together with outside security professionals and other third parties, we are conducting investigations into the Cyber Incident which are on-going. Our investigations to date revealed that as part of this attack, malicious code, or Sunburst, was injected into builds of our Orion Software Platform that we released between March 2020 and June 2020. If present and activated in a customer’s IT environment, Sunburst could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion Software Platform was installed. We have not located Sunburst in any of our more than seventy non-Orion products and tools. We released remediations for the versions of our Orion Software Platform known to be affected by Sunburst and have taken and continue to take extensive efforts to support and protect our customers. In addition, we shared our proprietary code with industry researchers to enable them to validate a “kill-switch” that is believed to have rendered Sunburst inert. The Orion Software Platform is installed “on-premises” within customers’ IT environments, so we are unable to determine with specificity the number of customers that installed an affected version or that were compromised as a result of Sunburst. We believe the actual number of customers that could have installed an affected version of the Orion Software Platform to be fewer than 18,000. Based on our discussions with customers and our investigations into the nature and function of Sunburst and the tradecraft of the threat actor, we believe the number of organizations which were exploited by the threat actors through Sunburst to be substantially fewer than the number of customers that may have installed an affected version of the Orion Platform. It has been widely reported that, due to its nature, sophistication and operational security, this “supply-chain” cyberattack was part of a broader nation-state level cyber operation designed to target public and private sector organizations. As of the date hereof, we have not independently attributed the Cyber Incident to any specific threat actor. Through our investigations into the Cyber Incident, we hope to understand it better, apply our findings to further adapt and enhance our security measures across our systems and our software development and build environments and share our findings and adaptations with our customers, government officials and the technology industry more broadly to help them better understand and protect against these types of attacks in the future. We refer to these adaptations and enhancements as “Secure by Design.” As described below, we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to the Cyber Incident. We are also party to lawsuits and the subject of governmental investigations related to the Cyber Incident. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Cyber Incident and Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these lawsuits and investigations . 41 Expenses Through December 31, 2020, we recorded $3.5 million of pretax expenses related to the Cyber Incident. We have included $0.1 million of these expenses in cost of recurring revenue, $0.3 million in sales and marketing expense and $3.2 million in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the Cyber Incident, and legal and other professional services related thereto, and consulting services being provided to customers at no charge, all of which were expensed as incurred. Litigation, Claims and Government Investigations As a result of the Cyber Incident, we are subject to numerous lawsuits and investigations or inquiries as described in Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we will incur costs and other expenses associated with these proceedings and investigations, it is not possible to estimate the amount of any loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and investigations based on the early stage thereof, the fact that alleged damages have not been specified, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Future Costs We expect to incur significant legal and other professional services costs and expenses associated with the Cyber Incident in future periods. We expect to recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Cyber Incident that will be incurred in future periods will include increased expenses associated with ongoing and any new claims, investigations and inquiries, as well as increased expenses and capital investments related to our “ Secure By Design ” initiatives, increased customer support activities and other related matters. We expect to incur increased expenses for insurance, finance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. We are also providing, at our cost, free third-party support services to customers related to the Cyber Incident. Although the ultimate magnitude and timing of expenses or other impacts to our business or reputation related to the Cyber Incident are uncertain, they could be significant. Insurance Coverage We maintain $15 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the Cyber Incident. Although our policy contains standard exclusions, we expect that a significant portion of the incremental expenses related to the remediation of and response to the Cyber Incident will be covered by insurance. Insurance reimbursements will also be treated as adjusting items, and the timing of recognizing insurance reimbursements may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses. Impacts of COVID-19 The impact from the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain. We initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by executing our business continuity plan and transitioning nearly all of our workforce to a remote working environment to prioritize the safety of our personnel. Substantially all of our workforce is currently working remotely. Due to the nature of our business, at this time, we have seen an impact on our financial results, including a decline in license revenue and increase in loss provision for accounts receivable, but do not expect to experience a significant impact on our financial results due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are unable to predict with a level of precision the longer term impact it may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the pandemic, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, its impact to the business of our customers and their end-customers and other factors identified in “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Potential Spin-Off of MSP Business On August 6, 2020, we announced that our board of directors has authorized management to explore a potential spin-off of our MSP business into a newly created and separately traded public company, and on December 9, 2020, we announced that we confidentially submitted with the SEC a Form 10 registration statement with respect to the potential spin-off. If completed, the standalone entity would provide cloud-based software solutions for MSPs, enabling them to support digital transformation and growth within SMEs. SolarWinds would retain our Core IT Management business focused primarily on selling software and cloud-based services to corporate IT organizations. We believe that, if completed, the potential spin-off would allow each company to more effectively pursue its distinct operating priorities, strategies and capital allocation policies, while also 42 allowing stockholders to separately evaluate and value the companies based on their distinct markets, strategies and performance. If we proceed with the spin-off, it would be intended to be structured as a tax-free, pro-rata distribution to all SolarWinds stockholders as of a record date to be determined by the board of directors of SolarWinds. If completed, upon effectiveness of the transaction, SolarWinds stockholders would own shares of both companies. Completion of any spin-off would be subject to various conditions, including final approval of our board of directors, and there can be no assurance that the potential spin-off will be completed in the manner described above, or at all. If we proceed with the spin-off, we currently are targeting to complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2021. We have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in connection with exploring the potential spin-off transaction of our MSP business into a newly created and separately traded public company. Spin-off exploration costs include legal, accounting and advisory fees, implementation and integration costs, duplicative costs for subscriptions and information technology systems, employee and contractor costs and other incremental separation costs related to the potential spin-off of the MSP business. The potential MSP spin-off transaction results in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. Spin-off exploration costs incurred were $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to incur additional spin-off exploration costs in future periods. Financial Highlights Our approach, which we call the “SolarWinds Model,” is based on our commitment to building a business that is focused on growth and profitability. Below are our key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue Our total revenue was $1.02 billion and $932.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our non-GAAP total revenue, which excludes the impact of purchase accounting, was $1.02 billion and $938.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Recurring revenue, which consists of subscription and maintenance revenue, represented approximately 86% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 82% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have increased our recurring revenue as a result of the growth in our subscription sales and the continued growth of our maintenance revenue. Our Core IT Management products are targeted for ITOps, DevOps, and IT security Professionals and provide hybrid IT performance management with a deep visibility into applications, databases, IT infrastructures, and the full IT stack, while remaining infrastructure-location agnostic. Core IT Management product revenue was $716.8 million and $669.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our MSP products enable MSPs to deploy, manage, and secure technologies for their SME end customers, as well as and more efficiently manage their own businesses. MSP product revenue was $302.5 million and $263.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We use Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue, or Subscription ARR, and Total Annual Recurring Revenue, or Total ARR, to evaluate the results of our recurring revenue model. Subscription ARR represents the annualized recurring value of all active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, Subscription ARR was $435.1 million, up from $371.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Total ARR represents the sum of Subscription ARR and the annualized value of all maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses active at the end of a reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, Total ARR was $959.7 million, up from $845.1 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase of 13.6%. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 320,000 customers. We have a broad and diverse customer base that is not concentrated in any segment or vertical industry. We define customers as individuals or entities that have purchased one or more of our products under a unique customer identification number since our inception for our perpetual license products and individuals or entities that have an active subscription for at least one of our subscription products. Each unique customer identification number constitutes a separate customer regardless of the amount purchased. We may have multiple purchasers of our products within a single organization, each of which may be assigned a unique customer identification number and deemed a separate customer. The SolarWinds Model allows us to both sell to a broad group of potential customers and close large transactions with significant customers. We increased our customer base by over 20,000 new customers in 2020 organically and through acquisitions. While some customers may spend as little as $100 with us over a twelve-month period, we had 1,057 customers who had spent more than $100,000 with us for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 897 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect that the continued growth in the use of public and private clouds, increased outsourcing of IT management services to MSPs and cross-selling of subscription products into our existing customer base could result in an increase in our 43 subscription revenue. We believe this increase, coupled with continued growth in maintenance revenue, could cause our recurring revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue over time. Our license revenue has declined as a percentage of total revenue primarily due to the higher growth of our recurring revenue and represented approximately 14% of our total revenue in 2020. We believe we have the potential to grow license revenue over time as we continue to invest in international sales growth, new product development and enhancements and increased productivity and efficiency of our sales and marketing operations. Profitability We have grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $158.5 million compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income for the period includes the impact of a discrete tax benefit of $138.2 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to an intra-group transfer of certain of our intellectual property rights. For additional discussion about our income taxes, see Note 15. Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Adjusted EBITDA was $489.7 million and $453.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash Flow We have built our business to generate strong cash flow over the long term. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash flows from operations were $389.1 million and $299.9 million, respectively. During those periods, our cash flows from operations were reduced by cash payments for interest on our long-term debt of $67.2 million and $100.5 million, respectively and cash payments for income taxes of $54.6 million and $48.0 million, respectively. Cyber Incident The Cyber Incident is expected to negatively impact revenue, profitability and cash flows in 2021 and beyond. Certain of our customers have, and others may, defer renewals or cancel subscriptions which would have a negative impact on our revenue. In addition, we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the Cyber Incident in future periods, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations, increased expenses and capital investments associated with our “Secure By Design” initiatives, increased customer support activities and other related matters , and increased costs and expenses for insurance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. See Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to the legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Cyber Incident. While we will incur costs and other expenses associated with these proceedings and investigations, it is not possible to estimate the amount of any loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and investigations based on the early stage thereof, the fact that alleged damages have not been specified, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues . Acquisitions SentryOne In October 2020, we acquired SQL Sentry Holdings, LLC, or SentryOne, a leading technology provider of database performance monitoring and DataOps solutions for approximately $145.1 million. We funded the transaction with cash on hand. The SentryOne offering complements our existing on-premises and cloud-native database management offerings to serve the full needs of the mid-market and better serve larger organizations. The addition of the SentryOne products to the SolarWinds portfolio also amplifies the depth and breadth of support SolarWinds can offer for Microsoft and Microsoft Azure environments. See Note 3. Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement s included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our acquisition of SentryOne. 44 Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue Our revenue consists of recurring revenue and perpetual license revenue. • Recurring Revenue. The significant majority of our revenue is recurring and consists of subscription and maintenance revenue. • Subscription Revenue. We primarily derive subscription revenue from fees received for subscriptions to our SaaS offerings, and to a lesser extent, our time-based license arrangements. Subscription revenue includes sales of our MSP products as well as our cloud infrastructure, application performance management and IT service management, or ITSM products. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term once the service is made available to the customer or when we have the right to invoice for services performed. We generally invoice subscription agreements monthly based on usage or in advance over the subscription period on either a monthly or annual basis. Our subscription revenue grows as customers add new subscription products, upgrade the capacity level of their existing subscription products or increase the usage of their subscription products. Our revenue from MSP products increases with the addition of end customers served by our MSP customers, the proliferation of devices managed by those MSPs and the expansion of products used by those MSPs to manage end customers’ IT infrastructures. • Maintenance Revenue. We derive maintenance revenue from the sale of maintenance services associated with our perpetual license products. Perpetual license customers pay for maintenance services based on the products they have purchased. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably on a daily basis over the contract period. Our maintenance revenue grows when we renew existing maintenance contracts and add new perpetual license customers, and as existing customers add new products. In addition, we typically implement annual price increases for our maintenance services. Customers typically renew their maintenance contracts at our standard list maintenance renewal pricing for their applicable products. We generally invoice maintenance contracts annually in advance. • License Revenue. We derive license revenue from sales of perpetual licenses of our on-premises network, systems, storage and database management products to new and existing customers. We include one year of maintenance services as part of our customers’ initial license purchase. License revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the electronic license key. We allocate revenue to the license component based upon our estimated standalone selling prices, which is derived by evaluating our historical pricing and discounting practices in observable bundled transactions. In April 2020, we launched subscription pricing options for certain of our network, systems and database management products that have historically been sold as perpetual licenses. The new on-premises subscription option gives customers additional flexibility when purchasing our products. The on-premises subscription offerings are time-based revenue arrangements recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the software and support is recognized ratably over the contract period. On-premises subscription offerings are recorded in subscription revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. We plan to continue to sell perpetual licenses for these products and not require customers to transition to a subscription pricing model. The subscription pricing option may impact the mix of license and recurring revenue, but this impact is difficult to predict at this time due to uncertainty regarding the level of customer adoption of the new subscription pricing options. We expect a gradual shift in the mix between license and recurring revenue in each quarter as new customers purchase these on-premises subscription offerings. Cost of Revenue • Cost of Recurring Revenue. Cost of recurring revenue consists of technical support personnel costs, royalty fees, public cloud infrastructure and hosting fees and an allocation of overhead costs for our subscription revenue and maintenance services. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits and IT costs allocated based on headcount. • Amortization of Acquired Technologies. Amortization of acquired technologies primarily consists of amortization related to capitalized costs of technologies acquired in connection with the take private transaction in 2016, or Take Private, and to a lesser extent, acquired technologies from our other acquisitions. Operating Expenses Operating expenses consists of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as amortization of acquired intangibles. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation and an allocation of overhead costs based on headcount. The total number of employees as of December 31, 2020 was 3,340, as compared to 3,251 as of December 31, 2019. Our stock-based compensation expense has increased due to equity awards granted to our employees and directors and 45 we intend to continue to grant equity awards which will result in additional stock-based compensation expense in future periods. In addition, our stock-based compensation expense increased during 2020 due to modifications to certain stock awards to amend award terms and eliminate performance vesting conditions applicable to such awards. Our travel costs declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 and we expect this to continue for the duration of the pandemic. • Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of related personnel costs, including our sales, marketing and maintenance renewal and subscription retention teams. Sales and marketing expenses also includes the cost of digital marketing programs such as paid search, search engine optimization and management, website maintenance and design. We expect to continue to hire personnel globally to drive new sales and maintenance renewals. • Research and Development. Research and development expenses primarily consist of related personnel costs. We expect to continue to grow our research and development organization, particularly internationally. • General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, general restructuring charges and other acquisition and spin-off exploration costs, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. • Amortization of Acquired Intangibles. We amortize to operating expenses the capitalized costs of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Take Private and our other acquisitions. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest expense and gains (losses) resulting from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated accounts. We expect interest expense to decrease as we repay indebtedness. Foreign Currency As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenue, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. See “Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” for additional information on how foreign currency impacts our financial results. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense consists of domestic and foreign corporate income taxes related to the sale of products. The tax rate on income earned by our North American entities is higher than the tax rate on income earned by our international entities. We expect the income earned by our international entities to grow over time as a percentage of total income, which may result in a decline in our effective income tax rate. However, our effective tax rate will be affected by many other factors including changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, shifts in the allocation of income earned throughout the world and changes in overall levels of income before tax. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-group transfer of certain of our intellectual property to our Irish subsidiary, where our international business is headquartered, or the IP Transfer. The transaction will change our mix of international income from a lower non-U.S. tax jurisdiction to Ireland, which is subject to a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. We recognized a discrete tax benefit of $138.2 million as a result of the IP Transfer. For additional discussion about our income taxes, see Note 15. Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 Revenue 46 Total revenue increased $86.7 million, or 9.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from North America was approximately 65% and 66% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during these periods. We expect our international total revenue to increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue as we expand our international sales and marketing efforts across our product lines. Core IT Management product revenue was $716.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $669.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of 7.1%. MSP product revenue was $302.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $263.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of 14.8%. Recurring Revenue Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue increased $75.7 million, or 23.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to sales of additional MSP products, with additional contribution from our acquired SolarWinds Service Desk and Database Performance Monitor products. Our subscription revenue increased as a percentage of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net retention rate for our subscription products was approximately 105% for each of the trailing twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and was driven primarily by strong customer retention and expansion in our MSP products. We define our net retention rate for subscription products as the implied monthly subscription revenue at the end of a period for the base set of customers from which we generated subscription revenue in the year prior to the calculation, divided by the implied monthly subscription revenue one year prior to the date of calculation for that same customer base. Maintenance Revenue. Maintenance revenue increased $31.8 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a growing maintenance renewal customer base from sales of our perpetual license products, strong maintenance renewal rates and annual maintenance price increases. Our maintenance renewal rate for our perpetual license products was approximately 91% and 94%, respectively, for the trailing twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in the maintenance renewal rate for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due a planned downgrade on one large U.S. Federal maintenance renewal in the first quarter of 2020 and, to a lesser extent, a decline in renewals due to the Cyber Incident in December 2020. We expect our maintenance renewals rates may decline or fluctuate in future periods as a result of the Cyber Incident. We define our maintenance renewal rate as the sales of maintenance services for all existing maintenance contracts expiring in a period, divided by the sum previous sales of maintenance services corresponding to those services expiring in the current period. Sales of maintenance services includes sales of maintenance renewals for a previously purchased product and the amount allocated to maintenance revenue from a license purchase. License Revenue License revenue decreased $20.9 million, or 12.6%, primarily due to decreased sales of our licensed products resulting from the difficult economic environment during the year as a result of the global recession caused by COVID-19 and the Cyber Incident in December 2020 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the subscription sales of our network, systems and database management products that have historically been sold only as perpetual licenses. We expect our license sales may decline or fluctuate in future periods as a result of the Cyber Incident. Cost of Revenue Total cost of revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in public cloud infrastructure and hosting fees related to our subscription products of $6.9 million, personnel costs to support new customers and additional product offerings of $4.1 million, which includes a $0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and other amortization of $3.3 million. The increase in amortization of acquired technologies is primarily related to intangibles acquired through our acquisitions in 2019. 47 Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $34.3 million, or 13.0%, primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $30.6 million, which includes an increase of $11.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and increases in marketing program costs of $5.5 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in travel and acquisition related costs of $4.6 million. We increased our sales and marketing employee headcount and marketing program costs to support the growth in the business and through the acquisitions. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $15.9 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $17.6 million, which includes an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in travel costs of $1.4 million. We increased our worldwide research and development employee headcount to expedite delivery of product enhancements and new product offerings to our customers and through acquisitions. General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses increased $40.0 million, or 41.0%, primarily due to a $28.8 million increase in personnel costs, which includes a $22.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $11.3 million increase in costs related to the exploration of a potential spin-off of our MSP business, a $3.2 million increase in costs related to the Cyber Incident and a $1.1 million increase in our provision for losses on accounts receivables. These increases were partially offset by decreases in restructuring costs of $2.7 million and offering and travel costs of $1.9 million. The increase in stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to modifications of stock awards during the year. See Note 11. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) and Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the stock award modifications. The increase in our provision for losses on accounts receivables is primarily related to a settlement with a distributor, from customers acquired in recent acquisitions and customers potentially impacted by the current economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $5.2 million, or 7.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to amortization related to our acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2020. See Note 3. Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our acquisitions including the intangible assets acquired. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased by $32.2 million, or 29.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to decreases in interest rates on our debt. The weighted-average effective interest rate on our debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.4% compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 9. Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. 48 Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased by $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to various accounts for the period. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $128.2 million as compared to income tax expense of $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in the effective tax rate for the period was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit of $138.2 million that was recognized as a deferred tax asset related to the IP Transfer. For additional discussion about our income taxes, see Note 15. Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Part II, Item 7. “ Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2020. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that is meaningful when assessing our operating performance because they exclude the impact of certain amounts that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance, allocating resources, preparing annual budgets and determining compensation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision-making of management in operating the business. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure included below. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. Items such as the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer-paid payroll taxes, acquisition related adjustments, costs related to the exploration of a potential spin-off of our MSP business and the Cyber Incident and restructuring charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items can have a material impact on our GAAP financial results. 49 Non-GAAP Revenue We define non-GAAP subscription revenue, non-GAAP maintenance revenue, non-GAAP license revenue and non-GAAP total revenue, as subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, license revenue and total revenue, respectively, excluding the impact of purchase accounting from our Take Private transaction in early 2016 and acquisitions. We monitor these measures to assess our performance because we believe our revenue growth rates would be overstated without these adjustments. We believe presenting non-GAAP subscription revenue, non-GAAP maintenance revenue, non-GAAP license revenue and non-GAAP total revenue aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance. Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin We provide non-GAAP operating income and related non-GAAP margin using non-GAAP revenue as discussed above and excluding such items as the write-down of deferred revenue related to purchase accounting, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer-paid payroll taxes, acquisition and other costs, spin-off exploration costs, restructuring costs and Cyber Incident costs. Management believes these measures are useful for the following reasons: • Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the amortization of acquired intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions, which also vary in frequency from period to period. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. • Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Related Employer-Paid Payroll Taxes. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation and related employer-paid payroll taxes. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. Employer-paid payroll taxes on stock-based compensation is dependent on our stock price and the timing of the taxable events related to the equity awards, over which our management has little control, and does not correlate to the core operation of our business. Because of these unique characteristics of stock-based compensation and related employer-paid payroll taxes, management excludes these expenses when analyzing the organization’s business performance. • Acquisition and Other Costs. We exclude certain expense items resulting from the Take Private and other acquisitions, such as legal, accounting and advisory fees, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, costs related to integrating the acquired businesses, deferred compensation, severance and retention expense. In addition, we exclude 50 certain other costs including expense related to our offerings. We consider these adjustments, to some extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, acquisitions result in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude acquisition and other costs, allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies, both with and without such adjustments. • Spin-off Exploration Costs. We exclude certain expense items resulting from the exploration of a potential spin-off transaction of our MSP business into a newly created and separately traded public company. These costs include legal, accounting and advisory fees, implementation and integration costs, duplicative costs for subscriptions and information technology systems, employee and contractor costs and other incremental separation costs related to the potential spin-off of the MSP business. The potential MSP spin-off transaction results in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. • Restructuring Costs. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes restructuring costs such as severance and the estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments, as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities and costs related to the separation of employment with executives of the Company. These costs are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these costs for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. • Cyber Incident Costs. We exclude certain expenses resulting from the Cyber Incident. Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the Cyber Incident, and legal and other professional services related thereto, and consulting services being provided to customers at no charge. Cyber Incident costs are provided net of insurance reimbursements, although the timing of recognizing insurance reimbursements may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses. We expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Cyber Incident in future periods. The Cyber Incident results in operating expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. We continue to invest significantly in cybersecurity and expect to make additional investments. These estimated investments are in addition to the Cyber Incident costs and not included in the net Cyber Incident costs reported. 51 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We regularly monitor adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, as it is a measure we use to assess our operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, excluding the impact of purchase accounting on total revenue, amortization of acquired intangible assets and developed technology, depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense and related employer-paid payroll taxes, restructuring costs, acquisition and other costs, spin-off exploration costs, Cyber Incident costs, interest expense, net, debt related costs including fees related to our credit agreements, debt extinguishment and refinancing costs, unrealized foreign currency (gains) losses, and income tax expense (benefit). We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by non-GAAP revenue. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting in connection with our acquisition, and therefore includes revenue that will never be recognized under GAAP; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the use of the term varies from others in our industry. ________________ (1) Unrealized foreign currency (gains) losses primarily relate to the remeasurement of our intercompany loans and unrealized foreign currency (gains) losses on selected assets and liabilities. We established a foreign currency denominated intercompany loan as part of the Take Private to provide a conduit to utilize foreign earnings effectively. The gains (losses) associated with the changes in exchange rates on amounts borrowed were unrealized non-cash events. As of July 1, 2018, this foreign currency denominated intercompany loan was designated as long-term due to a change in our investment strategy and the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act. Therefore, beginning on July 1, 2018, the foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2019, we determined that the intercompany loan will not be repaid and it was reclassified as a capital contribution. (2) Debt related costs include fees related to our credit agreements, debt refinancing costs and the related write-off of debt issuance costs. See Note 9. Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. 52 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $370.5 million as of December 31, 2020. Our international subsidiaries held approximately $163.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 39.6% were held in Euros. We intend either to invest our foreign earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our U.S. entities in a tax-free manner with the exception for immaterial state income taxes. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution. Our primary source of cash for funding operations and growth has been through cash provided by operating activities. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and financial position. In addition, currently it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties, or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations resulting from the Cyber Incident. Such potential payments, if great enough, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. However, despite these uncertainties, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, fund required debt repayments and meet our commitments for capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Although we are not currently a party to any material definitive agreement regarding potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, applications or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements, which could reduce our cash and cash equivalents, require us to seek additional equity or debt financing or repatriate cash generated by our international operations that could cause us to incur withholding taxes on any distributions. Additional funds from financing arrangements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Indebtedness As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $1.9 billion, with up to $125.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 9. Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. First Lien Credit Agreement The First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million, or the Revolving Credit Facility, consisting of a $25.0 million U.S. dollar revolving credit facility, or the U.S. Dollar Revolver, and a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Multicurrency Revolver. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $35.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The First Lien Credit Agreement also contains a term loan facility (which we refer to as the First Lien Term Loan, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, as the First Lien Credit Facilities) in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,990.0 million. The First Lien Credit Agreement provides us the right to request additional commitments for new incremental term loans and revolving loans, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) $400.0 million and (ii) 100% of our consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement (calculated on a pro forma basis), for the most recent four fiscal quarter period, or the First Lien Fixed Basket, plus (b) the amount of certain voluntary prepayments of the First Lien Credit Facilities, plus (c) an unlimited amount subject to pro forma compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.75 to 1.00. Under the U.S. Dollar Revolver, $7.5 million of commitments will mature on February 5, 2021, and $17.5 million along with all commitments under the Multicurrency Revolver will mature on February 5, 2022. The First Lien Term Loan will mature on February 5, 2024. The First Lien Term Loan requires equal quarterly repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount. Summary of Cash Flows Summarized cash flow information is as follows: 53 Operating Activities Our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by the timing of our sales. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities. For 2020 compared to 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items including deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. The change in deferred taxes is primarily related the deferred tax asset recognized as a result of the IP Transfer during the year ended December 31, 2020. The net cash inflow resulting from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities was $41.4 million for 2020 as compared to $12.9 million in 2019 and was primarily due to the timing of sales and cash payments and receipts. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was reduced by $54.6 million of cash paid for taxes which includes an $8.1 million cash payment related to the transition tax as a result of the Tax Act. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and intangible assets. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to purchases of leasehold improvements, computers, servers and equipment to support our domestic and international office locations. Purchases of intangible assets consist primarily of capitalized research and development costs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions. See Note 3. Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Purchases of property and equipment increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to purchases of leasehold improvements to expand certain office locations and servers and equipment. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of issuance and repayments associated with our long-term debt, the proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through equity incentive plans and the repurchase of unvested incentive restricted stock and common stock to satisfy withholding tax requirements related to the settlement of restricted stock units. Net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and option exercises, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock. In 2020 we withheld and retired shares of common stock to satisfy $12.1 million of statutory withholding tax requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees related to the settlement of restricted stock units during the period. These shares are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in financing activities for 2019 includes the proceeds and repayment of $35.0 million in borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. For each period, we made quarterly principal payments of $19.9 million due under our First Lien Credit Agreement. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 that require us to make future cash payments: ________________ (1) Represents principal maturities of our Senior Secured First Lien Credit Facility in effect at December 31, 2020. The estimated cash interest expense is based upon an interest rate of 2.90%. 54 (2) Represents maturities of operating lease liabilities, see Note 7. Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. As of December 31, 2020, we had a lease agreement in which the lease did not commence prior to year-end and therefore the lease liabilities had not been recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. The future minimum lease payments under this lease are approximately $29.0 million over a lease term of eleven years. (3) Purchase obligations primarily represent outstanding purchase orders for purchases of software license and support fees, public cloud infrastructure and hosting fees, corporate health insurance costs, marketing activities, accounting, legal and contractor fees and computer hardware and software costs. (4) Represents the provisional one–time transition tax as a result of the Tax Act which we have elected to pay over eight years. See Note 15. Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. (5) Other long-term obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2020 included non-current income tax liabilities of $32.7 million, which are primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot reasonably estimate the period during which this obligation may be incurred, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The impact from the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain. We have made estimates of the impact of COVID-19 within our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 which did not result in material adjustments. The estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, allowances for credit losses, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets and other long-lived assets, valuation allowances for tax assets and revenue recognition. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected, perhaps materially. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application, while in other cases, management’s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We believe that these accounting policies requiring significant management judgment and estimates are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas of our financial results. These critical accounting policies are: • the valuation of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets and contingent consideration; • revenue recognition; • stock-based compensation; • income taxes; and • loss contingencies. Acquisitions The purchase price of our acquired businesses is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on significant judgments made by management. We typically engage third-party valuation appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of the assets acquired. The valuation estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from management, and also include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows earned from the intangible asset and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill Our goodwill was derived from the Take Private transaction and acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to our reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. An impairment of goodwill is recognized when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. For purposes of the annual impairment test, we assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test which considers the fair value of the reporting unit compared with the carrying value on the date of the test. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter, we performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units. As of October 1, 2020 our Core IT, Application Management, ITSM and MSP reporting units had allocated goodwill of $2.9 billion, $65.1 million, $286.2 million 55 and $853.7 million, respectively. For the annual impairment analysis, we assessed several events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, including the significance of the amount of excess fair value over carrying value, consistency of operating margins and cash flows, budgeted-to-actual performance from prior year, overall change in economic climate, changes in the industry and competitive environment, key management turnover, and earnings quality and sustainability. As of October 1, 2020, there were no unanticipated changes or negative indicators in the above qualitative factors that would impact the fair value of our reporting units as of the annual impairment analysis date. As such, we determined there were no indicators of impairment and that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying values and therefore performing the next step of impairment test was unnecessary. In December 2020, subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we became aware that we were the target of a cybersecurity attack that involved the insertion of a vulnerability within our Orion Software Platform, which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run. The Orion Software Platform is part of our portfolio of products in our Core IT reporting unit. We considered the impact of the Cyber Incident on our evaluation of goodwill impairment indicators made during our October 1, 2020 annual test. As part of the analysis, we considered the decline in the stock price subsequent to the Cyber Incident and estimated impacts to new license sales, maintenance renewals and incremental costs as a result of the Cyber Incident and determined it appropriate to perform a quantitative assessment of our reporting units as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 our Core IT, Application Management, ITSM and MSP reporting units had allocated goodwill of $3.0 billion, $61.6 million, $286.2 million and $874.1 million, respectively. We also engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the performance of the impairment analysis of our reporting units. For the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, we utilized a combination of both an income and market approach to evaluate each of our reporting units. The income approach is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value. The discounted cash flow models reflect our assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, estimated implications of the Cyber Incident to our cost structure, economic and market trends and other expectations about the anticipated operating results of our reporting units. We discounted the estimated cash flows for each of the reporting units using rates that represent a market participant’s weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the reporting unit’s underlying business operations and utilized discount rates of 9%, 11%, 12% and 10% for our Core IT, Application Management, ITSM and MSP reporting units, respectively. The market approach develops an indication of fair value by calculating average market pricing multiples of revenues and EBITDA for selected peer publicly-traded companies. The developed multiples were applied to applicable financial measures of the respective reporting unit to determine an estimated fair value. We applied a 66.7% weighting to the income approach and a 33.3% weighting to the market approach to arrive at the total fair value used for impairment testing. We applied a greater weighting to the income approach as we believe the income approach is a better indicator of fair value by using projected cash flows of the reporting units being valued. After determining the fair value of each of our reporting units, we reconciled the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the Company's market capitalization as of December 31, 2020. As a result of the impairment analysis, our Core IT and ITSM reporting units were determined to have fair values that exceeded their carrying values by approximately 15.6% and 17.4%, respectively, and therefore no impairment was recognized. The other reporting units' fair values significantly exceed their carrying values. Fair value determinations of our reporting units require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the quantitative goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of future results. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our Core IT and ITSM reporting units may include such items as: (i) a decrease in future cash flows due to lower than expected license sales or maintenance renewals and higher than estimated costs to respond to the cybersecurity attack, (ii) higher than expected customer attrition resulting from customer concerns related to the cyber matter, (iii) adverse loss exposure from claims, fines or penalties from the Cyber Incident; and (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other macroeconomic factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital. Accordingly, if our current cash flow assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may be recorded in the future. Identifiable Intangible Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets and other assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment or our finite-lived intangibles and other assets, that revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results. 56 Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from fees received for subscriptions, the sale of maintenance services associated with our perpetual license products and the sale of perpetual license products. We recognize revenue related to contracts from customers when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This is determined by following a five-step process which includes (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price and (5) recognizing revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We identify performance obligations in a contract based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are identifiable from other promises in the contract, or distinct. If not considered distinct, the promised goods or services are combined with other goods or services and accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining the distinct performance obligations in a contract requires judgment. Our performance obligations primarily include perpetual and time-based licenses, maintenance support including unspecified upgrades or enhancements to new versions of our software products and SaaS offerings. We allocate the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis. Determining standalone selling prices for our performance obligations requires judgment and are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical selling prices and discounting practices for products and services, internal pricing policies and pricing practices in different regions and through different sales channels. For our subscription products and maintenance services, our standalone selling prices are generally observable using standalone sales or renewals. For our perpetual and time-based license products, given there are no observable standalone sales, we estimate our standalone selling prices by evaluating our historical pricing and discounting practices in observable bundled transactions. We review the standalone selling price for our performance obligations periodically and update, if needed, to ensure that the methodology utilized reflects our current pricing practices. Stock-Based Compensation We have granted our employees, directors and certain contractors stock-based incentive awards. Our stock awards vest on service-based or performance-based vesting conditions. These awards are in the form of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. We measure stock-based compensation expense for all share-based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the date of grant. The fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards and restricted stock is determined using the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant less any amount paid at the time of the grant, or intrinsic value. We use various assumptions that can be subjective in estimating the fair value of options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option model including expected dividend yield, volatility, risk-free rate of return and expected life. In addition, we estimate the probability of the performance-based awards vesting upon the achievement of the specified performance targets at each reporting period. Based on the extent to which the performance targets are achieved, shares vest at a specified percent of the target award amount. Changes in the probability estimates associated with performance-based awards are accounted for in the period of change using a cumulative expense adjustment to apply the new probability estimate. In any period in which we determine the achievement of the performance targets is not probable, we cease recording compensation expense and all previously recognized compensation expense for the performance-based award is reversed. Because the actual number of shares to be awarded is not known until the end of the performance period, the actual compensation expense related to these awards could differ from our current expectations. Income Taxes We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. The guidance requires us to identify, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. To the extent that the actual results of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect our effective tax rate. 57 We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, reversal of taxable temporary differences and carryback potential to realize the net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $14.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-group transfer of certain of our intellectual property rights to our Irish subsidiary which resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related tax benefit of $138.2 million based on the current fair value of the intellectual property transferred. We applied significant judgment when determining the fair value of the intellectual property, which serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset, and in evaluating the associated tax laws in the applicable jurisdictions. The fair value of the intellectual property is based on the present value of projected cash flows related to the intellectual property, which reflects management’s assumptions regarding projected revenues, operating expenses and discount rate. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the Irish tax rate expected to apply in the years the asset will be recovered. We expect to realize the deferred tax asset resulting from the transfer of the intellectual property rights and will assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset quarterly. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. The sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of the valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities. Loss Contingencies We account for claims and contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates a liability has been incurred at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that it is reasonably possible but not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, we disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if material or that the loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings related to the Cyber Incident. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. See Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of contingencies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference.","SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology, or IT, infrastructure management software.

The company’s total revenue was $1.02 billion and $932.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company’s non-GAAP total revenue, which excludes the impact of purchase accounting, was $1.02 billion and $938.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Recurring revenue, which consists of subscription and maintenance revenue, represented approximately 86% of its total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 82% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The company has increased its recurring revenue as a result of the growth in its subscription sales and the continued growth of its maintenance revenue.
The company’s  Core IT Management products are targeted for ITOps, DevOps, and IT security Professionals and provide hybrid IT performance management with a deep visibility into applications, databases, IT infrastructures, and the full IT stack, while remaining infrastructure-location agnostic. Core IT Management product revenue was $716.8 million and $669.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The company’s MSP products enable MSPs to deploy, manage, and secure technologies for their SME end customers, as well as and more efficiently manage their own businesses. MSP product revenue was $302.5 million and $263.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The company uses Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue, or Subscription ARR, and Total Annual Recurring Revenue, or Total ARR, to evaluate the results of its recurring revenue model. Subscription ARR represents the annualized recurring value of all active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, Subscription ARR was $435.1 million, up from $371.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Total ARR represents the sum of Subscription ARR and the annualized value of all maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses active at the end of a reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, Total ARR was $959.7 million, up from $845.1 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase of 13.6%.
As of December 31, 2020, the company had over 320,000 customers. The company has a broad and diverse customer base that is not concentrated in any segment or vertical industry.
The company has grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. The company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $158.5 million compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income for the period includes the impact of a discrete tax benefit of $138.2 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to an intra-group transfer of certain of its intellectual property rights.
The company has built its business to generate strong cash flow over the long term. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash flows from operations were $389.1 million and $299.9 million, respectively. During those periods, the company’s cash flows from operations were reduced by cash payments for interest on its long-term debt of $67.2 million and $100.5 million, respectively and cash payments for income taxes of $54.6 million and $48.0 million, respectively.
In October 2020, the company acquired SQL Sentry Holdings, LLC, or SentryOne, a leading technology provider of database performance monitoring and DataOps solutions for approximately $145.1 million. The company funded the transaction with cash on hand. The SentryOne offering complements the company’s existing on-premises and cloud-native database management offerings to serve the full needs of the mid-market and better serve larger organizations. The addition of the SentryOne products to the SolarWinds portfolio also amplifies the depth and breadth of support SolarWinds can offer for Microsoft and Microsoft Azure environments.
Total revenue increased $86.7 million, or 9.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from North America was approximately 65% and 66% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10% or more of its total revenue during these periods. The company expects its international total revenue to increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue as it expands its international sales and marketing efforts across its product lines. Core IT Management product revenue was $716.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $669.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of 7.1%. MSP product revenue was $302.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $263.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of 14.8%.
Total cost of revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in public cloud infrastructure and hosting fees related to its subscription products of $6.9 million, personnel costs to support new customers and additional product offerings of $4.1 million, which includes a $0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and other amortization of $3.3 million. The increase in amortization of acquired technologies is primarily related to intangibles acquired through its acquisitions in 2019.
Interest expense, net decreased by $32.2 million, or 29.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to decreases in interest rates on its debt. The weighted-average effective interest rate on its debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.4% compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash and cash equivalents were $370.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The company’s international subsidiaries held approximately $163.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 39.6% were held in Euros.
As of December 31, 2020, the company’s total indebtedness was $1.9 billion, with up to $125.0 million of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
The First Lien Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million, or the Revolving Credit Facility, consisting of a $25.0 million U.S. dollar revolving credit facility, or the U.S. Dollar Revolver, and a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Multicurrency Revolver. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $35.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The First Lien Credit Agreement also contains a term loan facility (which the company refers to as the First Lien Term Loan, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, as the First Lien Credit Facilities) in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,990.0 million.
For 2020 compared to 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items including deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. The change in deferred taxes is primarily related the deferred tax asset recognized as a result of the IP Transfer during the year ended December 31, 2020. The net cash inflow resulting from the changes in its operating assets and liabilities was $41.4 million for 2020 as compared to $12.9 million in 2019 and was primarily due to the timing of sales and cash payments and receipts. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was reduced by $54.6 million of cash paid for taxes which includes an $8.1 million cash payment related to the transition tax as a result of the Tax Act.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and intangible assets. The company’s capital expenditures primarily relate to purchases of leasehold improvements, computers, servers and equipment to support its domestic and international office locations. Purchases of intangible assets consist primarily of capitalized research and development costs.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock under its employee stock purchase plan and option exercises, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock.

"Our Business We develop, sell and support products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence with real-time artificial intelligence to neutralize cyberattacks as they occur – including Zero-Day attacks. We market and distribute our solutions through a direct sales force and value-added resellers. Our end-user customers include U.S. federal government entities, state and local government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises. Our Solutions INTRUSION Shield INTRUSION Shield , our cornerstone cybersecurity solution is a comprehensive, real-time AI-based Security-as-a-Service that inspects and kills all dangerous network connections before they can do damage. What makes our approach unique is that it inspects every packet of inbound and outbound traffic and analyzes the reputation of the IP addresses (source and destination), the domain and ports it is communicating on, along with many other fields in the packet to neutralize malicious connections. Most breaches today are caused by malware free compromises that trigger no alarms in a firewall or endpoint solution. The common denominator is network communications, which Shield monitors and analyses, allowing Shield to identify and stop all attacks, even malware-free attacks. Shield ’ s capabilities continuously evolve based on constant machine learning and neural networking technology. Unlike traditional industry approaches that rely heavily on human mitigation and defensive approaches, which malicious actors and nation states have learned to bypass, Shield ’s proprietary architecture isolates and neutralizes malicious traffic and network flows that existing solutions cannot identify before they harm a corporation or government organization. Shield is designed as a next generation Network Detection and Response solution. After 30 years of providing research, analysis, tools and services to the federal government and enterprise corporations, Intrusion possesses a comprehensive and proprietary data set of petabytes of Internet traffic, including information about the activities of malicious online actors. Shield integrates this rich TraceCop data set with artificial intelligence (AI) and Savant real-time process flow technology to provide our customers with a unique and affordable tool to detect, identify, and neutralize cyberattacks. In particular, the Shield AI has been specifically trained to identify and stop Zero-Day attacks and ransomware, the most prolific and crippling forms of malware today. INTRUSION TraceCop INTRUSION TraceCop is our big data tool with extensive IP intelligence canvassing the entire Internet. It contains largest repository of reputation information on known good and known bad active IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). TraceCop contains an inventory of network selectors and enrichments useful to support forensic investigations . The data contains a history of IPv4 and IPv6 block allocations and transfers, historical mappings of IP addresses to Autonomous Systems (ASNs) as observed through BGP, and approximately one billion historically registered domain names and registration context. TraceCop contains tens of billions of historic DNS resolutions of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs or hostnames) on each of these domains. Together, this shows relationships, hosting, and attribution for Internet resources. TraceCop also contains web server content surveys of content, such as natural language and topic of the content on hundreds of millions of websites and servers and OS fingerprints of services showing applications running on an IP. This context allows Shield to assess the use and purpose of an Internet resource. TraceCop also contains a history of threat and reputation for each hostname and IP address over time. All this makes it a very effective network forensics and cybersecurity analysis tool to inform Shield. INTRUSION Savant INTRUSION Savant is a network monitoring solution that leverages the rich data available in TraceCop to identify suspicious traffic in real-time. Savant uses several original patents to uniquely characterize and record all network flows. Savant is a network reconnaissance and attack analysis tool used by forensic analysts in the DoD, Federal Government and corporations with in-house threat research teams. For example, Savant users can create various automated rules to inspect packets matching (or not) certain criteria such as creating a rule to ensure the Source MAC address field in the Ethernet header and Source IP address from the IP header are always the same, failing which could indicate MAC or IP Spoofing in progress. Similarly, threat investigators can create rules using regular expressions by combining multiple fields in the packet headers. Ultimately, the rich capabilities of Savant provides the real-time analysis that Shield uses to make decisions on whether or not a packet is malicious. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, income taxes, warranty obligations, maintenance contracts and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware, perpetual software licenses and data sets. Data set updates are the majority of sales. We do not currently offer software on a subscription basis. Warranty costs and sales returns for our current products have not been material. We recognize sales of our data sets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers is not recognized until all five of the following have been met: Data updates are typically done monthly, and revenue will be matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and customer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy using the relative selling price method. All of our solution offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone sales. We may defer and recognize maintenance, updates and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year. Service revenue, primarily including maintenance, training and installation, are recognized upon delivery of the service and typically are unrelated to product sales. To date, maintenance, training and installation revenue has not been material. Our normal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically and net 45 days internationally. We do not offer payment terms that extend beyond one year and rarely do we extend payment terms beyond our normal terms. If certain customers do not meet our credit standards, we do require payment in advance to limit our credit exposure. Shipping and handling costs are billed to the customer and included in product revenue. Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product revenue. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our receivables are uncollateralized, and we expect to continue this policy in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, increased allowances may be required. Historically, our estimates for sales returns and doubtful accounts have not differed materially from actual results. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We calculate the fair value of our assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and include additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and dividends payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Financing leases and PPP loan approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest. Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue. 2020 compared with 2019 Net Revenue Total revenue decreased 51.5% to $6.6 million in 2020 from $13.6 million in 2019. We did not meet sales projections for our TraceCop product line. We expect our product revenues to increase in the future if we can increase sales to existing customers and add new customers. There were no export sales in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to our focus on domestic revenue sales. Sales of our products internationally may be subject to currency exchange risk, which may cause our products to effectively increase in price, if the exchange rate moves significantly and the dollar gains value over the foreign currency. Historically, due to the timing of our sales cycle, a significant portion of our monthly sales occurs in the second half of the month. Accordingly, our receivables increase at the end of each month, which causes a higher accounts receivable balance at month end. This monthly trend also causes an inflated comparative relationship between revenue and accounts receivable. We believe that this monthly trend will continue because monthly sales forecast and planning meetings are held in the first week of every month, the middle of the month is focused on sales calls to customers and the latter half of the month on closing sales. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 52.9% to $3.9 million in 2020 from $8.3 million in 2019. As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased from 60.8% in 2019 to 59.1% in 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 because of higher labor costs related to certain projects. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue is impacted by several factors, including shifts in product mix, changes in channels of distribution, sales volume, fluctuations in manufacturing costs, labor costs, pricing strategies, and fluctuations in sales of integrated third-party products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased to $3.8 million or 57.7% of net revenue in 2020, compared to $1.3 million or 9.5% of net revenue in 2019. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily two activities: building, training, and preparing a sales department to sell our new commercial product in 2021; and applying a dedicated $1.2 million marketing and promotion budget. Sales and marketing expenses may vary in the future. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase if net revenue levels increase in 2021. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased to $3.8 million or 57.4% of net revenue in 2020 compared to $1.3 million or 9.6% of net revenue in 2019. The increase in research and development expense was due to less labor expense shifted to direct labor costs. Our research and development costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase if we are able to increase net revenue levels in 2021. Research and development expense levels may fluctuate due to labor expense shifting to direct labor. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased to $2.8 million, or 42.5% of net revenue in 2020 compared to $1.2 million or 8.7% of net revenue in 2019. This was primarily a result of a non-cash write off for a $1.1 million abandoned operating lease asset. Other contributing expenses were related to increases in administrative and Human Resources. Excluding the $1.1 million non-cash write off for the abandonment of prior office lease, we expect general and administration expenses to remain constant but increase if net revenue levels increase in 2021. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $6 thousand in 2020, compared to $46 thousand in 2019. Interest expense decreased due to a combination of a zero balance under an unsecured revolving promissory note to borrow up to $3,700,000 from G. Ward Paxton, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Note”) and declining balances in financial leases and remained steady for operating leases. Interest expense will vary in the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs. Interest Income Interest income earned on bank deposits was $11 thousand in 2020 compared to $4 thousand in 2019. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 0% in 2020 and 2019 as valuation allowances have been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realization. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the Company’s statutory federal income tax rate from a maximum of 39% to a rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity at December 31, 2020 was $16.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, we did not hold investments with a stated maturity beyond one year. Working capital at December 31, 2020 was $16.2 million, while at December 31, 2019, it was $3.1 million. Net cash used in operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $5.2 million due primarily to a net loss of $6.5 million and the following uses of cash: a $339 thousand decrease in deferred revenue, a $258 thousand increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $334 thousand decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This was partially offset by these sources of cash and non-cash items: a $1.1 million non-cash write-off for an abandoned operating lease asset, a $333 thousand decrease in accounts receivable, $322 thousand in stock-based compensation, $231 thousand in depreciation expense and amortization expense, and $294 thousand in noncash lease costs. Net cash provided by operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, was $4.3 million due primarily to a net income of $4.5 million and the following sources of cash and non-cash items: $232 thousand in noncash lease costs, a $401 thousand decrease in accounts receivable, $184 thousand in depreciation expense and amortization expense, $47 thousand in stock-based compensation, and $6 thousand in waived penalties on dividends. This was partially offset by a $496 thousand decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $488 thousand decrease in deferred revenue, and a $61 thousand increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Future fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventory balances and accounts payable will be dependent upon several factors, including quarterly sales, timely collection of accounts receivable, and the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand and component requirements. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $320 thousand for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was $260 thousand for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $18.9 million with proceeds of $18.2 million from a stock offering, $629 thousand from a PPP loan, and proceeds from exercise of stock options of $209 thousand. This was directly offset by the following uses of cash: payments for preferred stock dividends of $99 thousand and payment on principal of finance right-of-use leases of $43 thousand. Net cash used in financing activities in 2019 was $2.3 million primarily due to payments on the loan by an officer of $1.8 million, $714 thousand payment of dividends on preferred stock, and $58 thousand payments on principal on financing leases. This was directly offset by a provision of cash of $239 thousand from the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2020, we had a commitment of $21 thousand for future finance lease liabilities. Operating lease commitments of $2.6 million are detailed in the Contractual Obligations section below. At December 31, 2019, we had a commitment of $66 thousand for future finance lease liabilities, while operating lease commitments were $1.8 million. During 2020, we funded our operations through the use of available cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.7 million, up from approximately $3.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We generated a net loss of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to fund our operations through anticipated Company profits together with the approximately $18 million in net proceeds we received from our Secondary Public Offering, which we believe will be sufficient to finance our operations, the additional expenses of marketing, promoting, and selling our new Shield solution and the development of its follow-on solutions, as well as other expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. We may explore the possible acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our existing business. We are continuing to identify and prioritize additional security technologies, which we may wish to develop, either internally or through the licensing, or acquisition of products from third parties. While we may engage from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions, there can be no assurances that any such acquisitions will be made or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business. In order to finance such acquisitions and working capital it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms, which are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning the future contractual obligations under our leases at December 31, 2020. We had no other significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020. Future minimum lease obligations consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 (in thousands): *Interest is imputed for operating ROU leases and classified as lease expense and is included in operating expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

"The following discussion (presented in thousands, except for percentages and share numbers) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC by Xperi Corporation on February 18, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.xperi.com. Business Overview On December 18, 2019, Xperi Corporation (“Xperi”) entered into a definitive agreement with TiVo Corporation (“TiVo”), to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Mergers”). Following consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation became the parent company of both Xperi and TiVo. The common stock of both Xperi and TiVo were de-registered after completion of the Mergers. On June 2, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “XPER.” Xperi was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Mergers. As a result, the historical financial statements of Xperi for periods prior to the Mergers are considered to be the historical financial statements of Xperi Holding Corporation. As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Xperi when referring to periods prior to June 1, 2020 and Xperi Holding Corporation when referring to periods subsequent to June 1, 2020. Our results of operations include the operations of TiVo after June 1, 2020. For further discussion on the Mergers, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Note 9 – Business Combination” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We are a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company and one of the industry’s largest intellectual property (IP) licensing platforms, with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor intellectual property and more than 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. We invent, develop, and deliver technologies that enable extraordinary experiences. Xperi technologies, delivered via our brands (DTS, HD Radio, IMAX Enhanced, Invensas, TiVo), and by our subsidiary, Perceive Corporation (“Perceive”), make entertainment more entertaining, and smart devices smarter. Our technologies are integrated into billions of consumer devices, media platforms, and semiconductors worldwide, driving increased value for partners, customers and consumers. We shape how millions of consumers access and experience entertainment content, and our innovations are found in billions of devices and hundreds of millions of interfaces around the globe. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with operations around the world, we have approximately 1,850 employees and over 30 years of operating experience . We are currently contemplating and may pursue, subject to any required regulatory approvals, a separation of our Product business and IP Licensing business through a tax-efficient transaction, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. We are evaluating the optimal timing of the contemplated business separation and currently anticipate that such separation will not be completed earlier than the first half of 2022. COVID-19 Impact Our business and results of operations have been adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic and related events and we expect its impact to continue. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to address its adverse impacts fully or effectively. The impact to date has included periods of significant volatility in various markets and industries. The volatility has had, and we anticipate it will continue to have, an adverse effect on our customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, increased credit losses and impairments of investments in other companies. In particular, the automotive market, as well as the broad consumer electronics industries, have been and we anticipate will continue to be impacted by the pandemic and/or other events beyond our control, and further volatility could have an additional negative impact on these industries, customers, and our business. For example, we experienced an approximately 15% decline in our royalty revenue in 2020 from our products sold to the automotive market, such as HD Radio, as compared to the prior year, and currently expect automotive royalties will remain below previous levels for at least the near-term. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and to a lesser extent, U.S. restrictions on trade with certain Chinese customers have and may continue to impact the financial conditions of our customers, who may not be able to satisfy their obligations under our agreements timely or at all. For example, we recorded provisions for credit losses of approximately $2.0 million and $4.3 million in the first and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, due to the 51 heightened risk of nonpayment on existing accounts receivable as a result of the impaired financial condition and liquidity positions of certain of our customers. In addition, actions by United States federal, state and foreign governments to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, stay-at-home orders and school, business and entertainment venue closures, also had a significant adverse effect on the markets in which we conduct our businesses. COVID-19 poses the risk that our workforce, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns or stay-at-home orders that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. We also implemented policies to allow our employees to work remotely as a result of the pandemic as we reviewed processes related to workplace safety, including social distancing and sanitation practices recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also cause delays in obtaining new customers and executing renewals and could also impact our business as consumer behavior changes in response to the slowed economic conditions. Furthermore, our ongoing integration efforts following the Mergers may be delayed or interrupted due to the operational challenges and various restrictions and limitations imposed on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may adversely affect the success of the integration and anticipated benefits of the Mergers. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, including legislation to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which was enacted on March 27, 2020. Although a significant portion of our anticipated revenue for 2021 is derived from fixed-fee and minimum-guarantee arrangements, primarily from large, well-capitalized customers which we believe somewhat mitigates the risks to our business, our per-unit and variable fees based revenue will continue to be susceptible to the volatility and potential market downturns induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the full impact and duration of COVID-19 on our business, we are actively managing our financial expenditures in response to the current uncertainty. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided under Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors . Results of Operations Significant events occurred over the past three years that affect the comparability of our financial statements. Key events and their financial impacts include the following: Revenue We generate our revenue from the following principal activities. License Agreements We operate in two business segments. In our Product segment, we license our audio, digital radio, imaging, edge-based machine learning and multi-channel video user experience (“UX”) solutions. In our IP Licensing segment, we license (i) our media patent portfolios (“Media IP licensing”) to multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), OTT video service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, social media, and other new media companies and (ii) our semiconductor technologies and associated patent portfolios (“Semiconductor IP licensing”) to memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. We license our technologies and portfolios under three revenue models: (i) fixed-fee Media IP licensing, (ii) fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP or Product licensing, and (iii) per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses. Fixed-fee Media IP licensing 52 Our long-term fixed-fee Media IP licensing agreements provide our customers with the rights to future patented technologies over the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the patented technologies provided at the inception of the agreement. We treat these rights as a single performance obligation with revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the fixed-fee license agreement. At times, we enter into license agreements in which a licensee is released from past patent infringement claims and is granted a license to ship an unlimited number of units or for an unlimited number of subscribers over a future period for a fixed fee. In these arrangements, we allocate the transaction price between the release for past patent infringement claims and the future license. As the release from past patent infringement claims is generally satisfied at execution of the agreement, the transaction price allocated to the release from past patent infringement claims is generally recognized in the period the agreement is executed and the amount of transaction price allocated to the future license is recognized ratably over the future license term. Fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP or Product licensing We enter into Product or Semiconductor IP licenses that have fixed fee or minimum guarantee arrangements, whereby licensees pay a fixed fee for the right to incorporate our technology in the licensee's products over the license term. In arrangements with a minimum guarantee, the fixed fee component corresponds to a minimum number of units or dollars that the customer must produce or pay, with additional per-unit fees for any units or dollars exceeding the minimum. In most cases, the customer pays the fixed license fee in specified installments over the license term. For both fixed fee and minimum guarantee agreements for Semiconductor IP or Product licensing, we recognize the full fixed fee as revenue at the beginning of the license term, when the licensee has the right to use the IP and begins to benefit from the license. If the contract term of a fixed fee or minimum guarantee arrangement is longer than one year, we also consider the scheduled payment arrangements to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In general, if the payment arrangements extend beyond the initial twelve months of the contract, we treat a portion of the payments as a significant financing component. The discount rate used for each arrangement reflects the rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction between us and the licensee at contract inception and takes into account the credit characteristics of the licensee and market interest rates as of the date of the agreement. As such, the amount of fixed fee revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term will be reduced by the calculated financing component. We actively monitor and enforce our IP, including seeking appropriate compensation from customers that have under-reported royalties owed under a license agreement and from third parties that utilize our intellectual property without a license. As a result of these activities, we may, from time to time, recognize revenue from payments resulting from periodic compliance audits of licensees for underreporting royalties incurred in prior periods, as part of a settlement of a patent infringement dispute, or from legal judgments in a license dispute. These recoveries and settlements may cause revenue to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and such recoveries may not occur in subsequent periods. We recognize revenue from recoveries when a binding agreement has been executed and we conclude collection under that agreement is likely. Per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses We recognize revenue from per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses in the period in which the licensee's sales or production are estimated to have occurred, which results in an adjustment to revenue when actual sales or production are subsequently reported by the licensee, which is generally in the month or quarter following usage or shipment. We generally recognize revenue from royalty licenses on a per-subscriber per-month model for licenses with service providers and a per-unit shipped or manufactured model for licenses with CE manufacturers and memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. Estimating licensees’ quarterly royalties prior to receiving the royalty reports requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments related to forecasted trends and growth rates used to estimate quantities shipped by customers, which could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we report on a quarterly basis. Arrangements with Multiple System Operators for the TiVo Service Our arrangements with multiple system operators (MSOs) typically include software customization and set-up services, associated maintenance and support, limited training, post-contract support, TiVo-enabled DVRs, non-DVR STBs and the TiVo service. We have two types of arrangements with MSOs that include technology deployment and engineering services. In instances where we host the TiVo service, non-refundable payments received for customization and set-up services are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the hosting term. The related cost of such services is capitalized to the extent it is deemed 53 recoverable and amortized to cost of revenue over the same period as the related TiVo service revenue is recognized. We estimate the stand-alone selling prices for training, DVRs, non-DVR STBs and maintenance and support based on the price charged in stand-alone sales of the promised good or service. The stand-alone selling price for the TiVo service is determined considering the size of the MSO and expected volume of deployment, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs and total gross margin objectives. For a term license to the TiVo service, we receive license fees for the hosted TiVo service on either a per-subscriber per-month basis or a fixed fee. We recognize revenue from per-subscriber per-month licenses during the month the TiVo service is provided to the customer and recognize revenue from fixed fee licenses ratably over the license period. In arrangements where we do not host the TiVo service and that include engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the licensed technology or involve significant customization or modification of the software, we recognize revenue as progress toward completion is made using an input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs of the project. Estimating project costs requires forecasting costs, tracking progress toward completion and projecting the remaining effort to complete the project. These estimates are reassessed throughout the term of the arrangement, and revisions to estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis when the changed conditions become known. We generally recognize revenue from license fees for the TiVo service that the Company does not host on a per-subscriber per-month basis due to the recognition constraint on intellectual property usage-based royalties. Subscription Services Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees to provide customers with access to one or more of our hosted products such as the iGuide IPG, advanced search and recommendations, metadata and analytics products, including routine customer support. We generally receive per-subscriber per-month fees for the iGuide IPG and search and recommendations service and revenue is recorded in the month the customer uses the service. We generally receive a monthly or quarterly fee from our metadata or analytics licenses for the right to use the metadata or access our analytics platform and to receive regular updates. Revenue from our metadata and analytics service is recognized ratably over the subscription period. TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs and related TiVo Service We sell TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs and the related service directly to customers through sales programs via the TiVo.com website and license the sale of TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs through a limited number of retailers. After the initial subscription period, all customers have various pricing options when they renew their subscription. The transaction price allocated to the DVR is recognized as revenue upon shipment to the customer and the transaction price allocated to the TiVo service is recognized as revenue ratably over the service period. Subscription revenue from lifetime subscriptions is recognized ratably over the estimated useful life of the DVR associated with the subscription. The estimated useful life for a DVR depends on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, customer retention rates, the timing of new product introductions and historical experience. We periodically reassess the estimated useful life of a DVR. When the actual useful life of the DVR materially differs from our estimates, the estimated useful life of the DVR is adjusted, which could result in the recognition of revenue over a longer or shorter period of time. 54 The following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue: The following table sets forth our revenue by year (in thousands, except for percentages): The $612.0 million or 219% increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from TiVo operations following the Mergers, which included revenue from the patent license agreement with Comcast as discussed below, and Semiconductor IP agreements executed during the first two quarters of 2020. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in per-unit royalty revenue from existing licensing agreements. On November 9, 2020, we entered into a patent license agreement (the “Agreement”) with Comcast and we resolved all of the outstanding litigation with Comcast. The Agreement is effective as of the expiration of Comcast’s prior agreement in 2016 and its term continues into 2031. The Agreement provided for an initial payment by Comcast upon execution and provides for ongoing payments through the remainder of the Agreement. In connection with the Agreement, we recorded revenue for past royalties in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expect to recognize revenue from the prospective license into 2031. Cost of Licensing, Services and Software Revenue, E xcluding Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible Assets Cost of licensing, services and software revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, consists primarily of employee-related costs, royalties paid to third parties, maintenance costs and an allocation of facilities costs, as well as service center and other expenses related to providing the TiVo Service, non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) services and our metadata offering. Cost of licensing, services and software revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $57.3 million, as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $49.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $49.0 million of TiVo expenses since the Mergers. 55 We anticipate cost of licensing, services and software revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, will continue to increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results . Cost of Hardware Revenue, E xcluding Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible Assets Cost of hardware revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, includes all product-related costs associated primarily with TiVo-enabled devices, including third-party manufacturing costs, employee-related costs, warranty costs, order fulfillment costs, certain licensing costs, and an allocation of facilities costs. Cost of hardware revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.1 million, as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $20.8 million. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $20.0 million of TiVo expenses since the Mergers. We anticipate cost of hardware revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, will continue to increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results as well as expected growth in sales of hardware products. Research, Development and Other Related Costs Research, development and other related costs (“R&amp;D expense”) are comprised primarily of employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, engineering consulting expenses associated with new product and technology development, product commercialization, quality assurance and testing costs, as well as costs related to patent applications and examinations, product ""tear downs"" and reverse engineering, materials, supplies, equipment depreciation and an allocation of facilities costs. All research, development and other related costs are expensed as incurred. R&amp;D expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $195.2 million as compared to $110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $84.3 million. The increase was due to the inclusion of $76.2 million of post-merger TiVo R&amp;D expenses in 2020, increased headcount and personnel costs in Perceive, an internal startup that focuses on delivering edge-based inference solutions, and severance charges incurred in connection with consolidating and optimizing post-merger operations. We believe that a significant level of R&amp;D expense will be required for us to remain competitive in the future. We also anticipate that R&amp;D expense will increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 due primarily to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results. Selling, General and Administrative Selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel engaged in sales and licensee support, reverse engineering personnel and services, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials, travel, trade show expenses, and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for general management, information technology, finance personnel, legal fees and expenses, facilities costs, stock-based compensation expense, and professional services. Our general and administrative expenses, other than facilities-related expenses, are not allocated to other expense line items. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $245.4 million, as compared to $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $127.7 million. The increase was due principally to the inclusion of $92.8 million of TiVo expenses, an increase in merger related transaction costs of $24.8 million, post-merger severance and retention costs of $14.3 million, and $4.8 million in costs associated with the contemplated separation of our business, partially offset by a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. We anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results. Depreciation Expense 56 Depreciation expense was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $11.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to depreciation expense on TiVo fixed assets added since the Mergers. We anticipate depreciation expense will continue to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of incurring the full year effect of TiVo’s assets after the Mergers. Amortization Expense Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $156.8 million, as compared to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $56.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the Mergers in June 2020, partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the past twelve months. As a result of the Mergers, we anticipate that amortization expenses will continue to be a significant expense since we acquired approximately $878.0 million in intangible assets which will be amortized over the next several years. See “Note 10 - Goodwill and Identified Intangible Assets” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information . Litigation Expense Litigation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $20.8 million, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $15.7 million. The increase was primarily due to inclusion of post-merger TiVo litigation expenses and increased case activity in 2020. In 2019 and 2020, prior to the Mergers, TiVo’s litigation expense was significantly higher than Xperi’s litigation expense in the same periods. We expect that litigation expense will continue to be a material portion of our operating expenses. Litigation expense may fluctuate between periods because of planned or ongoing litigation, as described in Part I, Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, and because of litigation planned for or initiated from time to time in the future in order to enforce and protect our intellectual property and contract rights. Upon expiration of our customers’ licenses, if those licenses are not renewed, litigation may become necessary to secure payment of reasonable royalties for the use of our patented technology. If we plan for or initiate such litigation, our future litigation expenses may increase . Stock-based Compensation Expense The following table sets forth our stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Stock-based compensation awards include restricted stock awards and units, employee stock plan purchases and employee stock options. The increase in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily a result of including incremental expense of $5.8 million from assumed TiVo stock awards and expenses from new, post-merger grants to legacy TiVo employees in 2020 as well as increases in restricted stock awards and units as a result of the Mergers. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $37.9 million, as compared to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of a higher average debt balance as compared to 57 2019 as we entered into a new term loan of $1,050 million on June 1, 2020 to refinance the indebtedness of the combined companies in connection with the Mergers. We anticipate interest expense will increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 as a result of a full year of the higher debt balance and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.5 million, as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other income was lower in the current year principally due to a decrease in interest income from financing components from revenue contracts, and secondarily from a decline in interest income from our short-term investments. Loss on Debt Extinguishment In connection with the Mergers, we refinanced the indebtedness of the combined Company, and recognized a loss on early debt extinguishment of $8.3 million in 2020. We did not incur a loss on early debt extinguishment in 2019 or 2018. Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7.9 million on a pretax income of $135.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (5.8)%. The income tax benefit of $7.9 million was primarily related to a net decrease in valuation allowance as a result of the Mergers, eligible deductions from foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”), releases of unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation, deductibility of certain transaction expenses, and unrealized foreign exchange gains from the prior period South Korea refund claim, partially offset by tax expense from operating income, withholding taxes, shortfalls from stock-based compensation, and certain non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $19.0 million on a pretax loss of $83.1 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.9%. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to tax benefit from operating losses, tax credits, the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets related to tax credits, and eligible deductions from FDII, offset by an increase in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets primarily related to capitalized research expenses, foreign withholding taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation and certain non-deductible expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed a refund claim for foreign taxes previously withheld from licensees in South Korea based on court rulings in South Korea and other business factors. These previously-withheld foreign taxes were claimed as a foreign tax credit in the U.S. As a result of the 2019 refund claim and a planned refund claim for 2020, we recorded $123.0 million and $65.2 million as a noncurrent income tax receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, $62.3 million and $48.2 million as a noncurrent income tax payable at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $36.7 million and $17.0 million as a reduction in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In making such assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. After considering both positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets, we determined that it was not more-likely-than-not that we would realize our federal, certain state and certain foreign deferred tax assets given the substantial amount of tax attributes that will remain unutilized to offset reversing deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2020. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the federal valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain federal deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change based on the factors present when reevaluating both positive and negative evidence. 58 Segment Operating Results In connection with the Mergers, we re-evaluated our reportable segments. We concluded that we have two reportable segments: (1) Product and (2) IP Licensing. There are certain corporate overhead costs that are not allocated to these reportable segments because these operating amounts are not considered in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. Our Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in accordance with the authoritative guidance on segment reporting. The Product segment consists primarily of licensing our internally-developed audio, digital radio, imaging, edge-based machine learning and multi-channel video user experience (“UX”) solutions. Audio, digital radio, imaging solutions and edge-based machine learning include the delivery of software and/or hardware-based solutions to our consumer electronics (“CE”) customers, automotive manufacturers or their supply chain partners. UX products and services revenue is primarily derived from multi-channel video service providers and CE manufacturers, licensing the TiVo service and selling TiVo-enabled devices like the Stream 4K, Personalized Content Discovery, enriched Metadata, viewership data and advertising. The IP Licensing segment consists primarily of licensing our innovations to leading companies in the media and semiconductor industries. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how. In media, our licensees include multichannel video programming distributors, OTT video service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, social media and other new media companies. In semiconductor, our licensees include memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. We do not identify or allocate assets by reportable segment, nor does the CODM evaluate reportable segments using discrete asset information. Reportable segments do not record inter-segment revenue and accordingly there are none to report. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate reportable segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The following table sets forth our segment revenue, operating expenses and operating income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): (1) Unallocated operating expenses consist primarily of selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses, such as administration, human resources, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement. These expenses are not allocated because these amounts are not considered in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments. For year ended December 31, 2020, the unallocated operating expenses were $249.1 million compared to $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $131.4 million was due primarily to the inclusion of TiVo expenses, one-time merger related transaction costs, post-merger severance and retention costs, and costs associated with the contemplated separation of our business. 59 The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section have been presented on a basis consistent with GAAP applied at the segment level. Of our $ 847.0 million in goodwill at December 31, 20 20 , approximately $ 523.8 million is allocated to our Product segment and approximately $ 323. 2 million is allocated to our IP Licensing segment . Product Segment (1) Excludes operating expenses which are not allocated on a segment basis. The increase in revenue in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to the inclusion of TiVo revenue since the Mergers and higher minimum guarantee (“MG”) revenue due to the timing and duration of MG contracts up for renewal and executed during 2020, partially offset by a decrease in per-unit royalty revenue from existing licensing arrangements driven primarily by the COVID-19 impact. The increase in operating expenses in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to the inclusion of TiVo Product expenses, increased headcount and personnel costs in Perceive, partially offset by lower legacy Xperi amortization expense due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the past twelve months. We expect R&amp;D expense will continue to be significant in this segment as we develop new products and solutions, and as we include a full year of R&amp;D expenses from TiVo operations in 2021. Operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $24.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively, which represented an increase of $12.6 million, for the reasons stated above. IP Licensing Segment (1) Excludes operating expenses which are not allocated on a segment basis. 60 The increase in revenue in 2020 , as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to inclusion of post-merger TiVo IP Licensing revenue including past royalt ies revenue from Comcast as discussed in “Results of O perations , ” and secondarily Semiconductor IP agreements executed during 2020, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from other Semiconductor IP license agreements . The increase in operating expenses in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to the inclusion of TiVo IP Licensing expenses, including significant amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the Mergers, partially offset by lower legacy Xperi amortization expense due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the past twelve months. In 2019 and in 2020, prior to the Mergers, TiVo’s litigation expenses were significantly higher than Xperi’s litigation expenses in the same periods. We expect that litigation expense will continue to be a material portion of our operating expenses and may fluctuate between periods because of planned or ongoing litigation, as described in Part I, Item 3 – Legal Proceedings , and because of litigation planned for or initiated from time to time in the future in order to enforce and protect our intellectual property and contract rights. Operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $402.6 million and $37.4 million, respectively, which represented an increase of $365.2 million, for the reasons stated above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are our operating cash flows and our short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $257.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $135.6 million from $121.5 million at December 31, 2019. This increase resulted primarily from $427.6 million in cash generated from operations, $1,010.3 million in net long-term debt proceeds received and $117.4 million in cash acquired from TiVo as a result of the Mergers, which was partially offset by $1,254.9 million in repayment of combined legacy indebtedness and the 2020 Term B Loan Facility, $80.6 million in repurchases of common stock, $50.9 million in purchases of intangible assets and $30.8 million in dividends paid. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $170.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $95.6 million from $74.6 million at December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by operations were $427.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to our net income of $143.8 million, non-cash items of depreciation of $17.9 million, amortization of intangible assets of $156.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $39.1 million and loss on debt extinguishment of $8.3 million, plus $76.8 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $34.7 million in deferred income taxes. Cash flows provided by operations were $169.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to our net loss of $64.0 million, non-cash items of depreciation of $6.7 million, amortization of intangible assets of $99.9 million and stock-based compensation expense of $31.6 million, plus $131.0 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $38.6 million in deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by investing activities was $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to net cash acquired in the Mergers of $117.4 million and maturities and sales of securities of $35.9 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $77.2 million, purchases of intangible assets of $50.9 million and capital expenditures of $7.4 million. 61 Net cash used in investing activities was $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the purchases of short-term available-for-sales securities of $40.0 million, $8.8 million in capital expenditures and patent acquisition of $4.5 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of securities of $34.1 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $351.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally due to $1,254.9 million in repayment of indebtedness, $80.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $30.8 million in dividends paid, partially offset by $1,010.3 million in net long-term debt proceeds and $4.9 million in proceeds due to the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option programs and employee stock purchase plans. Net cash used in financing activities was $189.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 principally due to $150.0 million in partial pay-down of debt principal, $39.5 million in dividends paid and $4.5 million in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $6.0 million in proceeds due to the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option programs and employee stock purchase plans. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and to maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a diversified portfolio of securities including money market funds and debt securities including corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes, commercial paper, treasury and agency notes and bills and certificates of deposit. We invest excess cash predominantly in high-quality investment grade debt securities with less than three years to maturity. Our marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale (“AFS”) with credit losses recognized as a credit loss expense and non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. We did not recognize a provision for credit loss expense related to our AFS debt securities in 2020. For 2019 and 2018, we did not record any impairment charges related to our AFS debt securities. In the third quarter of 2018, we initiated an equity position in Onkyo Corporation (“Onkyo”), a publicly traded company listed on the JASDAQ market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Under Topic 321, we measure equity securities with readily determinable market value at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income (loss). In July 2019, we sold approximately 2.8 million shares of Onkyo stock, for which a realized gain of $0.9 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019. In June 2020, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of Onkyo stock, for which a realized loss of $0.7 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no sales of the Onkyo investment in 2018, during which period an unrealized loss of $2.2 million was recognized. On December 1, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) which provided for a $600.0 million seven-year term B loan facility. The Term B Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2023. During 2019 we made three voluntary principal payments totaling $150.0 million, and upon consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, we repaid the full remaining balance of $344.0 million under the Credit Agreement. In addition, upon consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, we repaid $734.6 million of assumed TiVo debt with the proceeds from a new borrowing of $1,050 million discussed below. On June 1, 2020, in connection with the consummation of the Mergers, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “2020 Credit Agreement”) by and among us, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The 2020 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,050 million (the “2020 Term B Loan Facility”). The interest rate applicable to loans outstanding under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility is equal to, at our option, either (i) a base rate plus a margin of 3.00% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00% per annum. Commencing on September 30, 2020, the 2020 Term B Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments equal to (i) with respect to repayments occurring on or prior to June 1, 2023, 1.25% of the original principal amount of the 62 2020 Term B Loan Facility and (ii) with respect to repayments occurring after June 1, 2023 and prior to June 1, 2025, 1.875% of the original principal amount of the 2020 Term B Loan Facility, with the balance payable on the maturity date of the 2020 Term B Loan Facility (in each case subject to adjustment for prepayments). The 2020 Term B Loan Facility will mature on June 1, 2025. Upon the closing of the 2020 Credit Agreement, we borrowed $1,050 million under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility. Net proceeds were used on June 1, 2020, together with cash and cash equivalents, to repay existing indebtedness of the combined Company, including the aforementioned Term B Loan Facility with RBC. We commenced repaying quarterly installments under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility in the third quarter of 2020. The agreement permits prepayment of principal without penalty and on December 31, 2020 , w e elected to make a voluntary principal payment of $150.0 million. At December 31, 2020, $873.8 million was outstanding under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility with an interest rate, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, of 5.1%. Interest is payable monthly. Under the existing loan agreements, we have future minimum principal payments for our debt of $52.5 million annually through 2022, then $72.2 million and $78.8 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, with the remaining principal balance due in 2025. We are obligated to pay a portion of excess cash flow on an annual basis beginning March 31, 2022 based on certain ratios and our excess cash flow generated for the immediately preceding fiscal year as well as for any litigation settlements subsequent to the Mergers. The voluntary principal payment described above may be offset against any obligated payments due as of March 31, 2022. The 2020 Term B Loan Facility contains customary covenants, and as of December 31, 2020 we were in full compliance with such covenants . In August 2007, Xperi’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to repurchase Xperi’s outstanding shares of common stock dependent on market conditions, share price and other factors. This authorization was terminated upon closing of the Mergers. On June 12, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “new plan”) providing for the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common stock dependent on market conditions, stock price and other factors. Since the inception of the new plan, and through December 31, 2020, we have repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $70.1 million at an average price of $14.25 per share. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, our repurchases totaled $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the total remaining amount available for repurchase was $79.9 million. We may continue to execute authorized repurchases from time to time under the new plan. In 2020, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share in each of March and May and quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share in each of September and December. In 2019 and 2018, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share in each of March, June, September and December. From 2018 through 2020, we generated approximately $732 million of cash flows from operating activities. While we expect to continue to generate cash flows from operating activities for 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic presents significant uncertainties to the level of such cash flows as compared to prior years. Additionally, integration of the two legacy businesses post-merger and transaction costs relating to the contemplated separation of the two businesses will impact operating cash flow for 2021. We have taken actions to manage cash flows by reducing discretionary spending and other variable costs, delaying employee hiring, and closely monitoring receivables and payables. We believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, our cash from operations, together with cash, cash equivalents and investments currently available, will be sufficient to fund our operations, debt service, dividends, stock repurchases and acquisition needs for at least the next twelve months. Poor financial results, unanticipated expenses, unanticipated acquisitions of technologies or businesses or unanticipated strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or, if available, that such equity financing will be on terms satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current stockholders or that debt financing will not impose significant restrictions on the operation of our businesses. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands): 63 (1) Under the debt agreement, additional principal cash payments must be made on an annual basis beginning March 31, 2022 based on certain leverage ratios and excess cash flow generated for the immediately preceding fiscal year. See “Note 11 – Debt” for additional detail. (2) Under the debt agreement, our debt bears a variable interest rate. Interest on the long-term debt is presented based on the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2020. See “Note 11 – Debt” for additional detail. (3) Amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with purchase obligations to service providers, including the payments due within the next 12 months. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Operating leases are presented on a gross basis. We have agreements to receive payments of approximately $32.1 million under subleases through 2026. Refer to “Note 8 – Leases” for additional detail. Additionally, under certain contractual agreements, we may be obligated to make certain contingent or variable payments over an estimated period of approximately four years if certain conditions are met or milestones are achieved. See “Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. As of December 31, 2020, we had accrued $94.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits in long-term income taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions, which includes $2.5 million of accrued interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. If we are successful in receiving our South Korean withholding tax refund of $123.0 million, net of interest income and foreign exchange loss, then $62.3 million of unrecognized tax benefit would be payable to the U.S. tax authorities. These amounts, which are included in our financial statements, have not been included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates relate to revenue recognition, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, the valuation of investments, business combinations, recognition and measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, and others. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result. We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements. See “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ” and “Note 4 - Revenue ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of our accounting policies. Revenue recognition General Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services, which may include various combinations of goods and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. In situations where foreign withholding taxes are withheld by our licensee, revenue is recognized gross of withholding taxes that are remitted directly by the licensee to a local tax authority. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the individual performance obligations are separately accounted for if they are distinct. In an arrangement with multiple performance 64 obligations, the transaction price is allocated among the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The determination of stand-alone selling price considers market conditions, the size and scope of the contract, customer and geographic information, and other factors. When observable prices are not available, stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations is based on the cost-plus-margin approach, considering overall pricing objectives. The allocation of transaction price among performance obligations in a contract may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during a given period. Variable Consideration When a contract with a customer includes a variable transaction price, an estimate of the consideration which we expect to be entitled to for transferring the promised goods or services is made at contract inception. Depending on the terms of the contract, variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value approach or the most likely value approach. Under either approach to estimating variable consideration, the estimate considers all information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available at contract inception. The amount of variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated as additional information becomes available. The estimate of variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Subsequent changes in the transaction price resulting from changes in the estimate of variable consideration are allocated to the performance obligations in the contract on the same basis as at contract inception. Certain payments to licensees, retailers and distributors, such as market development funds and revenue shares, are treated as a reduction of the transaction price, and therefore a reduction to revenue, unless the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the licensee, retailer or distributor transfers to us. When variable consideration is in the form of a sales-based or usage-based royalty in exchange for a license of IP, or when a license of IP is the predominant item to which the variable consideration relates, revenue is recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs or the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. Nature of Goods and Services We generate our revenue from the following principal activities. License Agreements We operate in two business segments. In our Product segment, we license our audio, imaging, edge-based machine learning and multi-channel video user experience (“UX”) solutions. In our IP Licensing segment, we license (i) our media patent portfolios (“Media IP licensing”) to multichannel video programming distributors, OTT video service providers, social media, consumer electronics manufacturers, and other providers of video experiences across various platforms, and (ii) our semiconductor technologies and associated patent portfolios (“Semiconductor IP licensing”) to memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. We license our technologies and portfolios under three revenue models: (i) fixed-fee Media IP licensing, (ii) fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP or Product licensing, and (iii) per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses. Fixed-fee Media IP licensing Our long-term fixed-fee Media IP licensing agreements provide our customers with the rights to future patented technologies over the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the patented technologies provided at the inception of the agreement. We treat these rights as a single performance obligation with revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the fixed-fee license agreement. At times, we enter into license agreements in which a licensee is released from past patent infringement claims and is granted a license to ship an unlimited number of units or for an unlimited number of subscribers over a future period for a fixed fee. In these arrangements, we allocate the transaction price between the release for past patent infringement claims and the future license. As the release from past patent infringement claims is generally satisfied at execution of the agreement, the transaction price allocated to the release from past patent infringement claims is generally recognized in the period the agreement is executed and the amount of transaction price allocated to the future license is recognized ratably over the future license term. Fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP or Product licensing 65 We enter into Product or Semiconductor IP licenses that have fixed fee or minimum guarantee arrangements, whereby licensees pay a fixed fee for the right to incorporate our technology in the licensee's products over the license term. In arrangements with a minimum guarantee, the fixed fee component corresponds to a minimum number of units or dollars that the customer must produce or pay, with additional per-unit fees for any units or dollars exceeding the minimum. In most cases, the customer pays the fixed license fee in specified installments over the license term. For both fixed fee and minimum guarantee agreements for Semiconductor IP or Product licensing, we recognize the full fixed fee as revenue at the beginning of the license term, when the licensee has the right to use the IP and begins to benefit from the license. If the contract term of a fixed fee or minimum guarantee arrangement is longer than one year, we also consider the scheduled payment arrangements to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In general, if the payment arrangements extend beyond the initial twelve months of the contract, we treat a portion of the payments as a significant financing component. The discount rate used for each arrangement reflects the rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction between us and the licensee at contract inception and takes into account the credit characteristics of the licensee and market interest rates as of the date of the agreement. As such, the amount of fixed fee revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term will be reduced by the calculated financing component. We actively monitor and enforce our IP, including seeking appropriate compensation from customers that have under-reported royalties owed under a license agreement and from third parties that utilize our intellectual property without a license. As a result of these activities, we may, from time to time, recognize revenue from payments resulting from periodic compliance audits of licensees for underreporting royalties incurred in prior periods, as part of a settlement of a patent infringement dispute, or from legal judgments in a license dispute. These recoveries and settlements may cause revenue to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and such recoveries may not occur in subsequent periods. We recognize revenue from recoveries when a binding agreement has been executed and we conclude collection under that agreement is likely. Per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses We recognize revenue from per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses in the period in which the licensee's sales or production are estimated to have occurred, which results in an adjustment to revenue when actual sales or production are subsequently reported by the licensee, which is generally in the month or quarter following usage or shipment. We generally recognize revenue from royalty licenses on a per-subscriber per-month model for licenses with service providers and a per-unit shipped or manufactured model for licenses with CE manufacturers and memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. Estimating licensees’ quarterly royalties prior to receiving the royalty reports requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments related to forecasted trends and growth rates used to estimate customer sales or production, which could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we report on a quarterly basis. Arrangements with Multiple System Operators for the TiVo Service Our arrangements with multiple system operators (“MSOs”) typically include software customization and set-up services, associated maintenance and support, limited training, post-contract support, TiVo-enabled DVRs, non-DVR STBs and the TiVo service. We have two types of arrangements with MSOs that include technology deployment and engineering services. In instances where we host the TiVo service, non-refundable payments received for customization and set-up services are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the hosting term. The related cost of such services is capitalized to the extent it is deemed recoverable and amortized to cost of revenue over the same period as the related TiVo service revenue is recognized. We estimate the stand-alone selling prices for training, DVRs, non-DVR STBs and maintenance and support based on the price charged in stand-alone sales of the promised good or service. The stand-alone selling price for the TiVo service is determined considering the size of the MSO and expected volume of deployment, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs and total gross margin objectives. For a term license to the TiVo service, we receive license fees for the hosted TiVo service on either a per-subscriber per-month basis or a fixed fee. We recognize revenue from per-subscriber per-month licenses during the month the TiVo service is provided to the customer and recognize revenue from fixed fee licenses ratably over the license period. In arrangements where we do not host the TiVo service and that include engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the licensed technology or involve significant customization or modification of the software, we recognize revenue as progress toward completion is made using an input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs of the project. Estimating project costs requires forecasting costs, tracking progress toward completion and projecting the remaining effort to complete the project. These estimates are reassessed throughout the term of the arrangement, and revisions to estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis when the changed conditions become known. We 66 generally recognize revenue from license fees for the TiVo service that the Company does not host on a per-subscriber per-month basis due to the recognition constraint on intellectual property usage-based royalties. Subscription Services Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees to provide customers with access to one or more of our hosted products such as the iGuide IPG, advanced search and recommendations, metadata and analytics products, including routine customer support. We generally receive per-subscriber per-month fees for the iGuide IPG and search and recommendations service and revenue is recorded in the month the customer uses the service. We generally receive a monthly or quarterly fee from our metadata or analytics licenses for the right to use the metadata or access our analytics platform and to receive regular updates. Revenue from our metadata and analytics service is recognized ratably over the subscription period. TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs, including TiVo Stream 4K, and related TiVo Service We sell TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs and the related service directly to customers through sales programs via the TiVo.com website and license the sale of TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs through a limited number of retailers. After the initial subscription period for a DVR, all customers have various pricing options when they renew their subscription. The transaction price allocated to the DVR and non-DVR is recognized as revenue upon shipment to the customer and the transaction price allocated to the TiVo service is recognized as revenue ratably over the service period. Subscription revenue from lifetime subscriptions is recognized ratably over the estimated useful life of the DVR or non-DVR associated with the subscription. The estimated useful life for a DVR and non-DVR depends on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, customer retention rates, the timing of new product introductions and historical experience. We periodically reassess the estimated useful life of DVRs and non-DVRs. When the actual useful life of a DVR or a non-DVR materially differs from our estimates, the estimated useful life of the DVR or non-DVR is adjusted, which could result in the recognition of revenue over a longer or shorter period of time. Significant Judgments Determining whether promises to transfer multiple goods and services in contracts with customers are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment, including related to the level of integration and interdependency between the performance obligations. In addition, judgment is necessary to allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations, including whether there is a discount or significant financing component to be allocated based on the relative stand-alone selling price of the various performance obligations. Significant judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation when an observable price is not available. In instances where stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the good or service separately, the stand-alone selling price is determined using a range of inputs that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. More than one stand-alone selling price may exist for individual goods and services due to the stratification of those goods and services, considering attributes such as the size of the customer and geographic region. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on some performance obligations, significant judgment may be required to determine the transaction price. It is common for our license agreements to contain provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally estimated based on usage. In addition to estimating variable consideration, significant judgment is necessary to identify forms of variable consideration, determine whether the variable consideration relates to a sales-based or usage-based royalty of intellectual property and determine whether, and when to include estimates of variable consideration in the transaction price. For certain licensees, royalty revenue is generated based on a licensee’s production or shipment of licensed products incorporating our intellectual property, technologies or software. Licensees with a per-unit or per-subscriber arrangement pay a per-unit royalty for each product manufactured or sold, or for each subscriber, as set forth in its license agreement. Licensees generally report manufacturing, sales or subscriber information in the month or quarter subsequent to when the production, shipment or subscription activity takes place. We estimate the royalties earned each quarter based on our forecast of manufacturing and sales activity by our licensees in that quarter. Any differences between actual royalties owed by a licensee and our estimates are recognized when the licensee’s royalty report is received. Estimating licensees’ quarterly royalties prior to receiving the royalty reports requires us to make significant assumptions and judgments related to forecasted trends and growth rates used to estimate quantities manufactured, shipped or subscribed by licensees, which could have a material impact on the amount of revenue recognized. 67 Some hardware products are sold with a right of return and, in certain circumstances, credits or incentives may be provided to customers or resellers at the time of sale. Such credits and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration and recognized as a reduction to revenue. Estimates of returns, credits and incentives are made at contract inception and updated each reporting period. In contracts where we do not host the TiVo service and that include engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the licensed technology or involve significant customization or modification of software, or where we provide non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) services, we recognize revenue as progress toward completion occurs using an input method based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs of the project. Significant judgment is required to estimate the remaining effort to complete the project. These estimates are reassessed throughout the term of the arrangement. We evaluate our estimates, inputs and assumptions related to revenue recognition on an ongoing basis. The use of different estimates, inputs or assumptions may materially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the results of operations for the reporting period. Business combinations The fair value valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a Business combination under ASC 805 requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and acquired developed technologies and patents; competitive trends and market comparables; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; and discount rates. For additional information, refer to “Note 9 – Business Combination ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets We make judgments about the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. Such changes could result in impairment charges or higher amortization expense in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition. We perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill, the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management estimates and judgment. Should conditions be different from management’s last assessment, significant impairments of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Stock-based compensation expense Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service or performance period. We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”) that are based on company-designated performance targets. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the fair value of restricted stock units subject to market conditions with expected volatility estimated using the historical volatility of our common stock. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan (""ESPP"") shares. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula uses complex and subjective inputs, including the expected life of the options, stock price volatility, dividends and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which we believe are representative of future behavior. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on our stock’s market-based historical 68 volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and canceled. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See “ Note 1 4 - Stock-Based Compensation Expense ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. Accounting for income taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of tax assets and liabilities. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely on a more-likely-than-not basis, we must increase our provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes would fluctuate in the period of the change. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with authoritative guidance related to income taxes. The calculation of our unrecognized tax benefits involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. We record unrecognized tax benefits for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax liabilities are more-likely-than-not assuming the tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information. If we ultimately determine that the tax liabilities are unnecessary, we reverse the liabilities and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it occurs. This may occur for a variety of reasons, such as the expiration of the statute of limitations on a particular tax return or the completion of an examination by the relevant tax authority. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded unrecognized tax benefits are less than the expected ultimate settlement. Our policy is to classify accrued interest and penalties related to the accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not recognize any significant penalties or interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. See “Note 15 - Income Taxes ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption.","On December 18, 2019, Xperi Corporation (“Xperi”) entered into a definitive agreement with TiVo Corporation (“TiVo”), to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Mergers”). Following consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation became the parent company of both Xperi and TiVo. The common stock of both Xperi and TiVo were de-registered after completion of the Mergers. On June 2, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “XPER.”

XHC is a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company and one of the industry’s largest intellectual property (IP) licensing platforms, with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor intellectual property and more than 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. XHC invents, develops, and delivers technologies that enable extraordinary experiences. Xperi technologies, delivered via its brands (DTS, HD Radio, IMAX Enhanced, Invensas, TiVo), and by its subsidiary, Perceive Corporation (“Perceive”), make entertainment more entertaining, and smart devices smarter. The company’s technologies are integrated into billions of consumer devices, media platforms, and semiconductors worldwide, driving increased value for partners, customers and consumers. XHC shapes how millions of consumers access and experience entertainment content, and its innovations are found in billions of devices and hundreds of millions of interfaces around the globe. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with operations around the world, the company has approximately 1,850 employees and over 30 years of operating experience.

XHC generates its revenue from the following principal activities:
The company operates in two business segments. In its Product segment, XHC licenses its audio, digital radio, imaging, edge-based machine learning and multi-channel video user experience (“UX”) solutions. In its IP Licensing segment, the company licenses (i) its media patent portfolios (“Media IP licensing”) to multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), OTT video service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, social media, and other new media companies and (ii) its semiconductor technologies and associated patent portfolios (“Semiconductor IP licensing”) to memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies. XHC licenses its technologies and portfolios under three revenue models: (i) fixed-fee Media IP licensing, (ii) fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP or Product licensing, and (iii) per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses.

The $612.0 million or 219% increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from TiVo operations following the Mergers, which included revenue from the patent license agreement with Comcast as discussed below, and Semiconductor IP agreements executed during the first two quarters of 2020. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in per-unit royalty revenue from existing licensing agreements.

Cost of licensing, services and software revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $57.3 million, as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $49.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $49.0 million of TiVo. The company anticipates cost of licensing, services and software revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, will continue to increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results. R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $195.2 million as compared to $110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $84.3 million. The increase was due to the inclusion of $76.2 million of post-merger TiVo R&D expenses in 2020, increased headcount and personnel costs in Perceive, an internal startup that focuses on delivering edge-based inference solutions, and severance charges incurred in connection with consolidating and optimizing post-merger operations. XHC believes that a significant level of R&D expense will be required for the company to remain competitive in the future. XHC also anticipates that R&D expense will increase in 2021 when compared to 2020 due primarily to including a full year of TiVo operations in our consolidated results.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $245.4 million, as compared to $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $127.7 million. The increase was due principally to the inclusion of $92.8 million of TiVo expenses, an increase in merger related transaction costs of $24.8 million, post-merger severance and retention costs of $14.3 million, and $4.8 million in costs associated with the contemplated separation of our business, partially offset by a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $37.9 million, as compared to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense was primarily a result of a higher average debt balance as compared to 2019 as the company entered into a new term loan of $1,050 million on June 1, 2020 to refinance the indebtedness of the combined companies in connection with the Mergers.
XHC’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are the company’s operating cash flows and its short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $257.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $135.6 million from $121.5 million at December 31, 2019. This increase resulted primarily from $427.6 million in cash generated from operations, $1,010.3 million in net long-term debt proceeds received and $117.4 million in cash acquired from TiVo as a result of the Mergers, which was partially offset by $1,254.9 million in repayment of combined legacy indebtedness and the 2020 Term B Loan Facility, $80.6 million in repurchases of common stock, $50.9 million in purchases of intangible assets and $30.8 million in dividends paid. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $170.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $95.6 million from $74.6 million at December 31, 2019.

Cash flows provided by operations were $427.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to XHC’s net income of $143.8 million, non-cash items of depreciation of $17.9 million, amortization of intangible assets of $156.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $39.1 million and loss on debt extinguishment of $8.3 million, plus $76.8 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $34.7 million in deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by investing activities was $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to net cash acquired in the Mergers of $117.4 million and maturities and sales of securities of $35.9 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $77.2 million, purchases of intangible assets of $50.9 million and capital expenditures of $7.4 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $351.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally due to $1,254.9 million in repayment of indebtedness, $80.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $30.8 million in dividends paid, partially offset by $1,010.3 million in net long-term debt proceeds and $4.9 million in proceeds due to the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option programs and employee stock purchase plans.

On December 1, 2016, XHC entered into a Credit Agreement with Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) which provided for a $600.0 million seven-year term B loan facility. The Term B Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2023. During 2019 the company made three voluntary principal payments totaling $150.0 million, and upon consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, XHC repaid the full remaining balance of $344.0 million under the Credit Agreement. In addition, upon consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, the company repaid $734.6 million of assumed TiVo debt with the proceeds from a new borrowing of $1,050 million discussed below.
On June 1, 2020, in connection with the consummation of the Mergers, the company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “2020 Credit Agreement”) by and among the company, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The 2020 Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,050 million (the “2020 Term B Loan Facility”). The interest rate applicable to loans outstanding under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility is equal to, at the company’s option, either (i) a base rate plus a margin of 3.00% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00% per annum. Commencing on September 30, 2020, the 2020 Term B Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments equal to (i) with respect to repayments occurring on or prior to June 1, 2023, 1.25% of the original principal amount of the 2020 Term B Loan Facility and (ii) with respect to repayments occurring after June 1, 2023 and prior to June 1, 2025, 1.875% of the original principal amount of the 2020 Term B Loan Facility, with the balance payable on the maturity date of the 2020 Term B Loan Facility (in each case subject to adjustment for prepayments). The 2020 Term B Loan Facility will mature on June 1, 2025. Upon the closing of the 2020 Credit Agreement, XHC borrowed $1,050 million under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility. Net proceeds were used on June 1, 2020, together with cash and cash equivalents, to repay existing indebtedness of the combined Company, including the aforementioned Term B Loan Facility with RBC. The company commenced repaying quarterly installments under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility in the third quarter of 2020. The agreement permits prepayment of principal without penalty and on December 31, 2020, the company elected to make a voluntary principal payment of $150.0 million.
At December 31, 2020, $873.8 million was outstanding under the 2020 Term B Loan Facility with an interest rate, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, of 5.1%. Interest is payable monthly. Under the existing loan agreements, the company has future minimum principal payments for its debt of $52.5 million annually through 2022, then $72.2 million and $78.8 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, with the remaining principal balance due in 2025.

Company Overview Digital Turbine, Inc., through its subsidiaries, simplifies content discovery and delivers it directly to mobile devices. Its on-device media platform powers frictionless application and content discovery, user acquisition and engagement, operational efficiency, and monetization opportunities. Through March 31, 2021, Digital Turbine's technology platform has been adopted by over 35 mobile operators and device original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") and has delivered more than 5.3 billion application preloads for tens of thousands of advertising campaigns. The Company operates this business as one operating and reportable segment - Media Distribution, which was previously referred to as the operating segment O&amp;O (which refers to operators and OEMs) and the reportable segment Advertising. As the Company's suite of product offerings expands, both organically and through acquisitions, we believe that this renaming of our reporting and operating segment better reflects the way management views the business. There are no changes or historical differences to product offerings and financial information that were referred to as the Advertising segment in prior periods. While advertising, in general, remains a focus of our Media Distribution segment, we feel that this change in name more accurately conveys to the reader what we do for our customers and partners. The Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers. • Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices. • Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of: ◦ Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue – advertising within the content media that’s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand); ◦ Sponsored Content – sponsored content media from 3 rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC – Cost Per Click); ◦ Editorial Content – owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click). 47 With global headquarters in Austin, Texas and offices in Durham, North Carolina; San Francisco, California; Arlington, Virginia; São Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Singapore; and Tel Aviv, Israel, Digital Turbine’s solutions are available worldwide. For additional information, please visit www.digitalturbine.com. All dollar amounts are in thousands, except per share amounts. Recent Acquisitions The Company recently completed the below-described acquisitions of Appreciate, AdColony, and Fyber in order to help execute on its expressed strategy of becoming a leading end-to-end solution for mobile brand acquisition, advertising, and monetization. Appreciate. On March 1, 2021, DT EMEA entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Triapodi Ltd., an Israeli company (d/b/a Appreciate), the stockholder representative, and the stockholders of Appreciate pursuant to which DT EMEA acquired, on March 2, 2021, all of the outstanding capital stock of Appreciate in exchange for total consideration of $20,003 in cash.

AdColony Holding AS. On April 29, 2021, DT Media completed the acquisition of AdColony Holding AS, a Norway company (“AdColony”), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with AdColony and Otello Corporation ASA, a Norway company and the sole shareholder of AdColony (“Otello”).

Under the terms of the earn-out, DT Media would pay Otello a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) of AdColony depending on the extent to which AdColony achieves certain target net revenues (less associated cost of goods sold) over the Earn-Out Period.

The Company paid the cash closing amount on the closing date, and intends to pay the remainder of the cash consideration for the acquisition with a combination of available cash on hand, borrowings under the Company’s senior credit facility, and proceeds from future capital financings. Fyber is a leading mobile advertising monetization platform empowering global app developers to optimize profitability through quality advertising. Fyber’s proprietary technology platform and expertise in mediation, real-time bidding, advanced analytics tools, and video combine to deliver publishers and advertisers a highly valuable app monetization solution. Pursuant to certain German law on public takeovers, following the closing, the Company is obligated to make a public tender offer to the Minority Fyber Shareholders to acquire from them the Minority Fyber Shares. The tender offer will be subject to certain minimum price rules under German law. The timing and the conditions of the tender offer, including the consideration offered to the Minority Fyber Shareholders in connection with the tender offer, will be subsequently determined by the Company pursuant to the applicable Dutch and German takeover laws. The Company anticipates completing the tender offer during the second fiscal quarter 2022. Other Recent Developments February 2021 Credit Facility. On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (""the BoA Credit Agreement') with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”), which provides for a revolving line of credit of $100,000, with an accordion feature enabling the Company to increase the amount to up to $200,000, to be used for acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the BoA Credit Agreement. The revolving line of credit matures on February 3, 2024. In connection with the Company entering into the BoA Credit Agreement with the Bank as described above, on February 3, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance Bank terminated the Credit Agreement, dated February 28, 2020, by and among the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and Western Alliance Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous term loan and revolving credit facility of the Company. Amounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The obligations under the BoA Credit Agreement are secured by a grant of a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The BoA Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations, and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw. 49 April 2021 Credit Facility. Subsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and Mobile Posse is a guarantor (together with the Company, DT Media and DT USA, collectively, the “Loan Parties”). This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that permits an increase of the revolver by up to $75,000 plus an amount that would enable the Loan Parties to remain in compliance with a consolidated secured net leverage ratio, on such terms as agreed to by the parties. The revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company’s election, (i) LIBOR plus between 1.50% and 2.25% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate determined based upon the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.’s prime rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus between 0.50% and 1.25% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Loan Parties’ payment and performance obligations under the New Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by their grant of a security interest in substantially all of their personal property assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, subject to certain exclusions. If the Loan Parties acquire any real property assets with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, they are required to grant a security interest in such real property as well. All such security interests are required to be first priority security interests, subject to certain permitted liens.

The platform allows mobile operators to personalize the application activation experience for customers and monetize their home screens via revenue-share agreements such as: Cost-Per-Install (CPI), Cost-Per-Placement (CPP), and Cost-Per-Action (CPA) with third-party advertisers; or via Per-Device-License Fees (PDL) agreements, which allow operators and OEMs to leverage the platform, its products, and other features for a structured fee. Setup Wizard, Dynamic Installs, or Software Development Kit (""SDK"") are the delivery methods available to operators and OEMs on first boot of the device. Additional products and features are available throughout the life-cycle of the device that provide operators and OEMs additional opportunity for media delivery revenue streams. The Company has launched its software with operators and OEMs in North America, Latin America, Europe, Israel, and Asia-Pacific. The acquisition of Mobile Posse provides an additional platform option, outside of our core platform, to monetize user actions over the life-cycle of a device by delivering media-rich advertising content to the end user and providing operators and OEMs with an additional opportunity for revenue streams synergistic with our core platform. The Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers. • Application Media represents the portion of the business where our platform delivers apps to end users through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Application Media optimizes revenues by using developed technology to streamline, track, and manage app install demand from hundreds of application developers across various publishers, carriers, OEMs, and devices. • Content Media represents the portion of the business where our platform presents news, weather, sports, and other content directly within the native device experience (e.g., as the start page in the mobile browser, a widget, on unlock, etc.) through partnerships with carrier networks and OEMs. Content Media optimizes revenue by a combination of: ◦ Programmatic Ad Partner Revenue – advertising within the content media that’s sold on an ad exchange at a market rate (CPM - Cost Per Thousand); 50 ◦ Sponsored Content – sponsored content media from 3 rd party content providers, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when a recommended story is viewed (CPC – Cost Per Click); ◦ Editorial Content – owned or licensed media, presented similarly to an ad, that is monetized when the media is clicked on (CPC - Cost Per Click). Impact of COVID-19 on the Business Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, levels of business confidence, and consumer confidence. There is some uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and the demand for our service offerings. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on the impact to carriers and OEMs in relation to their sales of smartphones, tablets, and other devices. If COVID-19 continues to have a significant negative impact on global economic conditions over a prolonged period of time, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Presently, we are conducting business as usual, with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain marketing events, among other modifications. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations, as required or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Disposition of the Content Reportable Segment and A&amp;P Business On April 29, 2018, the Company entered into two distinct disposition agreements with respect to select assets owned by our subsidiaries. DT APAC and DT Singapore (together, “Pay Seller”), each wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Pay Agreement (the “Pay Agreement”), dated April 23, 2018, with Chargewave Ptd Ltd (“Pay Purchaser”) to sell certain assets (the “Pay Assets”) owned by the Pay Seller related to the Company’s Direct Carrier Billing business. The Pay Purchaser is principally owned and controlled by Jon Mooney, an officer of the Pay Seller. At the closing of the asset sale, Mr. Mooney was no longer employed by the Company or Pay Seller. As consideration for this asset sale, Digital Turbine is entitled to receive certain license fees, profit-sharing, and equity participation rights as outlined in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2018 with an effective date of July 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the reporting segment of the business previously referred to as the Content business. DT Media, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “A&amp;P Agreement”), dated April 28, 2018, with Creative Clicks B.V. (the “A&amp;P Purchaser”) to sell business relationships with various advertisers and publishers (the “A&amp;P Assets”) related to the Company’s Advertising and Publishing business. As consideration for this asset sale, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the gross profit, as defined by the A&amp;P Agreement, derived from these customer agreements for a period of three years, as outlined in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed on June 28, 2018 with an effective date of June 1, 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company exited the operating segment of the business previously referred to as the A&amp;P business, which was previously part of the Advertising segment, the Company's sole reporting segment (which is now Media Distribution). These dispositions have allowed the Company to benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure, and enhanced management focus. Discontinued Operations As a result of the dispositions, the results of operations from our Content reporting segment and A&amp;P business within the Media Distribution reporting segment, previously referred to as the Advertising segment, are reported as “Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes” and the related assets and liabilities are classified as “held for disposal"" on the prior comparative period Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company has recast prior period amounts presented within this report to provide visibility and comparability. Results of Operations All discussions in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise noted, relate to the remaining continuing operations in our sole operating segment after the dispositions, the Media Distribution business. 51 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Below are our revenues, costs of revenues, and expenses for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. This information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Item 8 in this Annual Report. Net revenues 52 Fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 During the year ended March 31, 2021, revenues increased $174,864, or 126.1%, compared to the prior year. The Company's Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory. During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Media Distribution business, primarily through silent application delivery, was the main driver of our revenues. Application Media revenue totaled $217,447 and $133,898, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, while Content Media revenue, primarily related to the Mobile Posse acquisition on February 28, 2020, totaled $96,132 and $4,817, respectively. Our application delivery and management software enables operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize applications installed at the time of activation and over the life of a device. The increase in net revenues of $83,549 related to our Application Media business was attributable to increased demand for our core services, and expanded platform offerings, which led to higher CPI and CPP revenue per available placement. Of this increase in Application Media revenue, approximately $59,900 is related to increases in demand for our core services, and approximately $23,649 is related to new and expanded platform offerings. The increase in net revenues of $91,315 related to our Content Media business, primarily from the acquisition of Mobile Posse, is a function of a full year of contribution in the current fiscal year, as opposed to one month of contribution in the previous fiscal year, as well as post acquisition technology synergies driving expansion across the existing Digital Turbine partner base. With respect to customer revenue concentration, the Company defines a customer as an advertiser or a carrier that is a distinct source of revenue and is legally bound to pay for the services that the Company delivers on the advertiser’s or carrier's behalf. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, no single customer represented more than 10% of net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues. With respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, T-Mobile US Inc., including Sprint and other subsidiaries, a carrier partner, generated 26.4%, AT&amp;T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 22.3%, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 18.5%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.8% of our net revenues. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3%, AT&amp;T Inc., including its Cricket subsidiary, a carrier partner, generated 30.0%, and America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., a carrier partner, generated 10.7% of our net revenues. A reduction or delay in operating activity from these customers or partners, or a delay or default in payment by these customers, or a termination of the Company's agreements with these customers, could materially harm the Company’s business and prospects. The Company is not aware of any material changes to these relationships, or material reductions or delays in operating activity with these customers or partners. Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 During the year ended March 31, 2020, revenues increased $35,146, or 33.9%, compared to the prior year. The Company's Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory. During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Media Distribution business, primarily through silent application delivery, was the main driver of our revenues. Our application delivery and management software enables operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize applications installed at the time of activation and over the life of a device. The increase in net revenues of $35,146 was primarily attributable to increased demand for our platform offerings, which led to higher CPI and CPP revenue per available placement. Of this increase, approximately $30,329 is related to organic increases in demand for our platform services, and approximately $4,817 is related to revenue contributions from the acquisition of Mobile Posse. With respect to customer revenue concentration, during the year ended March 31, 2020, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 15.3% of net revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2019, one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 28.6% of net revenues. 53 With respect to partner revenue concentration, the Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our platform through the carrier network. During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 37.3% and 45.9%, respectively, while AT&amp;T Inc., a carrier partner, including its Cricket subsidiary, generated 30.0% and 38.7%, respectively, of our net revenues. Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2020, America Movil, primarily through its subsidiary Tracfone Wireless Inc., generated 10.7% of our net revenues. Costs of revenues and operating expenses Fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 Total costs of revenues and operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $254,370 and $125,503, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $128,867 or 102.7%. This change is a result of continued growth including the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate. Company-wide cost control measures show the Company's ability to scale revenues at a greater rate than operating expenses. License fees and revenue share is reflective of amounts paid to our carrier and OEM partners who drive the revenues generated from advertising via direct CPI, CPP, or CPA arrangements with application developers, or indirect arrangements through advertising aggregators (ad networks) are shared with the carrier and the shared revenue is recorded as a cost of revenue. In each case the revenue share with the carrier varies depending on the agreement with the carrier, and, in some cases, is based upon revenue tiers. License fees and revenue share for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $178,649 and $83,588, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $95,061 or 113.7%. The increase in these costs of revenues over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues over the same period, as these costs are paid as a percentage of revenues. License fees and revenue share, as a percent of revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 57% and 60%, respectively. Other direct costs of revenues are comprised primarily of hosting expense directly related to the generation of revenues, and depreciation expense accounted for under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Other direct costs of revenues for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $2,358 and $1,454, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $904 or 62.2%. Product development expenses include the development and maintenance of the Company's product suite. Expenses in this area are primarily a function of talent. Product development expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $20,119 and $12,018, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $8,101 or 67.4%. The increase in product development expenses over the comparative period was primarily attributable to increased product development headcount, both organic and through the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate, and other employee-related and third-party development-related costs as the Company continues to scale its product development organization to support the Company's growth. Sales and marketing expenses represent the costs of sales and marketing talent, advertising and marketing campaigns, and campaign management. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $19,304 and $11,244, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $8,060 or 71.7%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the addition of new talent in existing markets related to the Company's continued expansion of its global footprint and increased commissions associated with the sales team generating more revenue through new and existing advertising relationships and markets. 54 General and administrative expenses represent management, finance, and support talent costs in both the parent and subsidiary companies, which include professional and consulting costs, in addition to other costs such as rent, stock-based compensation, and depreciation expense. General and administrative expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $33,940 and $17,199, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $16,741 or 97.3%. The increase over the comparative period is primarily attributable to employee-related expenses as a function of higher headcount, increased stock option expense, increases in depreciation and amortization related to capitalized internal-use software and intangible assets, and expenses incurred for the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate. Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 Total operating expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $125,503 and $100,124, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $25,379 or 25.3%. This change is a result of continued growth including the acquisition of Mobile Posse. Company-wide cost control measures show the Company's ability to scale revenues at a greater rate than operating expenses.

In each case the revenue share with the carrier varies depending on the agreement with the carrier, and, in some cases, is based upon revenue tiers. License fees and revenue share for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $83,588 and $65,981, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $17,607 or 26.7%. The increase in these costs of revenues over the comparative period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues over the same period, as these costs are paid as a percentage of revenues. License fees and revenue share, as a percent of revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 60% and 64%, respectively. Other direct costs of revenues are comprised primarily of hosting expense directly related to the generation of revenues, and depreciation expense accounted for under ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Other direct costs of revenues for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,454 and $2,023, respectively, representing a year-over-year decrease of approximately $569 or 28.1%. Product development expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $12,018 and $10,876, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $1,142 or 10.5%. The increase in costs over the comparative period is primarily a function of talent hired during fiscal year 2020 and hosting expenses associated with development activity. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $11,244 and $8,212, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $3,032 or 36.9%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses over the comparative period is primarily attributable to increased travel expenses for existing talent, the addition of new talent in existing markets related to the Company's continued expansion of its global footprint, and increased commissions associated with the sales team generating more revenue through new and existing advertising relationships and markets. General and administrative expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $17,199 and $13,032, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $4,167 or 32.0%. The increase over the comparative period is primarily attributable to employee-related expenses as a function of higher headcount, increased stock option expense, increase in depreciation and amortization related to capitalized internal-use software, and expenses incurred for the acquisition of Mobile Posse. 55 Interest and other income / (expense), net Fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 Total interest and other income / (expense), net, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(17,352) and $(9,307), respectively, an increase in net expenses of $8,045 or 86.4%. This change in total interest and other income / (expense), net, was primarily attributable to changes in interest income / (expense), fair value of warrant liability, and estimated contingent consideration related to the Mobile Posse acquisition. The change in fair value of warrant liability was due to all holders of the remaining outstanding warrants exercising all outstanding warrants during the year ended March 31, 2020. Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 Total interest and other income / (expense), net, for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(9,307) and $(7,278), respectively, an increase in net expenses of $2,029 or 27.9%. This change in total interest and other income / (expense), net, was primarily attributable to changes in interest income / (expense), fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, and fair value of warrant liability. The changes in fair values of the convertible note embedded derivative liability and warrant liability were due to the change in the Company's stock price from $3.50 at March 31, 2019 to $4.18 at March 31, 2020, partially offset by the settling of all of the remaining derivative instruments during the fiscal year. Interest income / (expense) In the year ended March 31, 2021, interest expense was attributable to 1) fees related to obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; 2) interest expense incurred on the prior credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, which was the previous senior credit facility of the Company that was terminated on February 3, 2021, at approximately 5.5% (LIBOR + 3.75% with a 1.75% LIBOR floor); and 3) interest expense incurred under the BoA Credit Agreement at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In the year ended March 31, 2020, interest expense was attributable to 1) fees related to obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; and 2) interest expense incurred on the prior credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, which was the previous senior credit facility of the Company that was terminated on February 3, 2021, at approximately 5.5% (LIBOR + 3.75% with a 1.75% LIBOR floor). During the majority of the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding debt and incurred no interest expense. In the year ended March 31, 2019, interest expense was primarily attributable to 1) fees related to the obtaining debt, which were recorded as debt issuance costs and expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt; 2) interest expense incurred from the $16,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Convertible Notes due 2020 (the “Notes”), issued on September 28, 2016; 3) from amounts drawn on our business finance agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Western Alliance Bank (the “Bank”) at approximately 6.75% (Wall Street Journal Prime Rate + 0.50%); and 4) amortization of debt discount related to the Notes, which were expensed as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt. 56 Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash. The Company recorded $(1,003), $41, and $(1,120) of aggregate interest income / (expense), inclusive of debt discount and debt issuance costs amortization, during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability The Company accounts for the convertible note embedded derivative liability issued in accordance with US GAAP accounting guidance under ASC 815 applicable to derivative instruments, which requires every derivative instrument within its scope to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. All convertible notes were settled prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 and therefore no amounts associated with this derivative liability were recognized in the year ended March 31, 2021 or 2020. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability of $1,008 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $2.01 at March 31, 2018 to $3.50 at March 31, 2019, partially offset by the settling of $5,700 of the underlying debt instruments. Change in fair value of warrant liability The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the above-noted sale of Notes in accordance with US GAAP accounting guidance under ASC 815 applicable to derivative instruments, which requires every derivative instrument within its scope to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Based on this guidance, the Company determined that these warrants did not meet the criteria for classification as equity. Accordingly, the Company classified the warrants as long-term liabilities. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of other income / (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss). Due to the valuation of the derivative liability being highly sensitive to the trading price of the Company's stock, the increase and decrease in the trading price of the Company's stock has the impact of increasing the (loss) and gain, respectively. All warrants related to these Notes were exercised during the year ended March 31, 2020 and the associated liability settled. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of warrant liability of $9,580 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $3.50 at March 31, 2019 to $4.18 at March 31, 2020, partially offset by the exercise of all remaining warrants. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss from change in fair value of warrant liability of $4,875 due to the increase of the Company's stock price from $2.01 at March 31, 2018 to $3.50 at March 31, 2019, partially offset by the exercise of 484,900 warrants. Change in estimated contingent consideration On February 28, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Mobile Posse, pursuant to the previously-reported stock purchase agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with ACME Mobile, LLC (“ACME”), Mobile Posse, and certain equity holders of ACME. The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Mobile Posse in exchange for an estimated total consideration of: (1) $41,500 in cash paid at closing (subject to customary closing purchase price adjustments) and (2) an estimated earn-out of $23,735, to be paid in cash, based on Mobile Posse achieving certain future target net revenues, less associated revenue shares, over a twelve-month period following the closing of the acquisition, noting that the earn-out amount is subject to change based on final results and calculation. Under the terms of the earn-out, over the earn-out period, the Company paid ACME a certain percentage of actual net revenues (less associated revenue shares) of Mobile Posse, depending on the extent to which Mobile Posse achieved certain target net revenues (less associated revenue shares) for the relevant period. Due to the financial results of Mobile Posse during the earn-out period, in addition to the initial estimated contingent consideration of $23,735, the Company made additional earn-out payments in the amount of $15,751 during the year ended March 31, 2021. The earn-out period concluded during the year ended March 31, 2021. 57 Loss on extinguishment of debt During the year ended March 31, 2021, connected with the early termination of the Western Alliance credit agreement, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $452, which represents the write-off of all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Western Alliance credit agreement, as well as cash expenses incurred for the early extinguishment of the credit facility. No loss on extinguishment of debt was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2020. During the year ended March 31, 2019, connected with the settlement of a portion of the convertible notes, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $431, which represents the difference between the carrying value of the settled debt (including underlying derivative instruments) and the consideration given to settle the debt, in this case primarily stock. Income taxes Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 740 requires the consideration of a valuation allowance, on a jurisdictional basis, to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s pre-tax income in the U.S. continued to increase such that the Company was no longer in a cumulative three-year loss position. Following the acquisition and integration of Mobile Posse, the Company was able to sustain this pre-tax income position throughout the full fiscal year. In the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021, based on management’s assessment of this income trend following the integration of Mobile Posse, we determined that the U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on expected future taxable income. A net tax benefit of $11,782 was realized in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as a result of the release of the U.S. valuation allowance. As part of the stock acquisition of Mobile Posse on February 28, 2020, the Company recorded a net U.S. deferred tax liability of $10,552 on the opening balance sheet. The deferred tax liability primarily related to intangible assets recorded at fair market value for financial accounting purposes compared to the carryover of historical tax basis. The acquired deferred tax liabilities represent a source of positive evidence with respect to the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets. In accordance with ASC 805-740-30-3, a change in the acquirer’s valuation allowance as a result of a business combination is recorded as a component of income tax expense. As a result of the business combination, the Company released $10,552 of valuation allowance as a component of income tax expense in the year ended March 31, 2020. The Company’s income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company establishes liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities for tax contingencies are established when the Company believes that a tax position is not more likely than not sustainable. The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax liabilities and changes in liabilities that are considered appropriate. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of changes in valuation allowance, tax deductions in excess of book for stock compensation, nondeductible changes in stock acquisition earn-out and warrant liabilities, and state income taxes. 58 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been issuances of common and preferred stock, debt, and cash from operations. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $31,118. The Company anticipates that its primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash-on-hand, cash provided by operations, and the credit available under the Company's senior credit facility. In addition, the Company may raise additional capital through future equity or, subject to restrictions contained in the Company's senior credit facility, debt financing to finance the future purchase price and earn-out payment obligations with respect to the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, provide for greater flexibility to make acquisitions, make new investments in under-capitalized opportunities, or invest in organic opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company issues additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of its existing stockholders would be reduced. New investors may demand rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. The Company believes that it has sufficient cash and capital resources to operate its business for at least twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BoA Revolving Line of Credit On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (""the BoA Credit Agreement') with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”), which provides for a revolving line of credit of $100,000, with an accordion feature enabling the Company to increase the amount to up to $200,000, to be used for acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the BoA Credit Agreement. The revolving line of credit matures on February 3, 2024. In connection with the Company entering into the BoA Credit Agreement with the Bank as described above, on February 3, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance Bank terminated the credit agreement dated February 28, 2020, by and among the Company, DT Media, DT USA, and Western Alliance Bank (and the amendments thereto), which was the previous term loan and revolving credit facility of the Company. 59 Amounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (or, if necessary, a broadly-adopted replacement index) plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The obligations under the BoA Credit Agreement are secured by a grant of a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The BoA Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations, and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw. April 2021 Credit Facility Subsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. DT Media and DT USA are additional co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and Mobile Posse is a guarantor (together with the Company, DT Media and DT USA, collectively, the “Loan Parties”). This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that permits an increase of the revolver by up to $75,000 plus an amount that would enable the Loan Parties to remain in compliance with a consolidated secured net leverage ratio, on such terms as agreed to by the parties. The revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company’s election, (i) LIBOR plus between 1.50% and 2.25% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) a base rate determined based upon the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.’s prime rate or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus between 0.50% and 1.25% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and events of default, and also requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Loan Parties’ payment and performance obligations under the New Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by their grant of a security interest in substantially all of their personal property assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, subject to certain exclusions. If the Loan Parties acquire any real property assets with a fair market value in excess of $5,000, they are required to grant a security interest in such real property as well. All such security interests are required to be first priority security interests, subject to certain permitted liens. Cash Flow Summary 60 Operating Activities During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $62,795 and $33,670, respectively, an increase of $29,125, or 86.5%. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts over the comparative periods. During the year ended March 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $62,795, resulting from net income of $54,884 offset by net non-cash expenses of $13,340, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in estimate of remaining contingent consideration, and payment of contingent consideration in excess of amounts capitalized at acquisition of approximately $7,114, $94, $4,853, $1,024, $255, $15,751, and $(15,751), respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The net impact of the change in estimated earn-out due to ACME Mobile for the acquisition of Mobile Posse and the payment of this additional earn-out is $0 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows; the $15,751 represents additional earn-out payments earned by ACME Mobile due to actual financial results during the earn-out period in excess of amounts capitalized under ASC 805 - Purchase Accounting . These amounts were all paid during the period. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of $32,456 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $24,540. During the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $33,670, resulting from net income of $14,280 offset by net non-cash expenses of $15,281, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, and change in fair value of warrant liability of debt of approximately $2,342, $6, $2,710, $643, and $9,580, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The change in fair value of warrant liability was a result of the settlement of all outstanding warrants related to the convertible notes during fiscal year 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2020 was negatively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2020 compared to March 31, 2019, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of approximately $15,239 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $272. During the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $4,970, resulting from a net loss of $4,302 offset by net non-cash expenses of $12,409, which included depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock-based compensation, stock-based compensation for services rendered, change in fair value of convertible note embedded derivative liability, change in fair value of warrant liability, and loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2,766, $798, $2,011, $520, $1,008, $4,875, and $431, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to capitalized software development costs and acquired technology and IP-related intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to options granted to our employees and, to a lesser extent, to restricted stock awards for executives and our Board of Directors. The change in fair value of warrant liability was primarily a result of the change in our stock price during fiscal year 2019, offset by the settlement of a portion of the outstanding warrants. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was positively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2019 compared to March 31, 2018, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of approximately $2,212 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $5,531. Investing Activities During the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was approximately $37,808, which includes capital expenditures of $9,204, comprised mostly of internally-developed software, the acquisition of Appreciate, net of cash, for $20,348, and earn-out payments associated with the acquisition of Mobile Posse, net of cash, for $8,256. During the year ended March 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was approximately $46,717, which includes capital expenditures of $4,845, comprised mostly of internally-developed software, and the acquisition of Mobile Posse, net of cash, for $41,872. 61 During the year ended March 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was approximately $2,314, which includes capital expenditures of $2,314, comprised mostly of internally-developed software. Financing Activities During the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was approximately $15,216, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings of $15,000 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of approximately $7,209, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $469, payment of contingent consideration of $16,956, and repayment of debt obligations of $20,000. During the year ended March 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was approximately $26,175, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings of $20,000 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $6,488, offset by payment of debt issuance costs of $313. During the year ended March 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was approximately $916, which is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants of approximately $734, offset by the repayment of debt obligations of approximately $1,650. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have not entered into any synthetic leases. We believe, therefore, that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at March 31, 2021: (a) Consists of operating leases for our office facilities. (b) We have approximately $1,077 in additional liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions that are not expected to be liquidated within the next twelve months. We are unable to reliably estimate the expected payment dates for these additional non-current liabilities. Cash Contractual Obligations Associated with Acquisitions Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of AdColony, we must pay $100,000 in cash on or before October 29, 2021 and an earn-out payment estimated between $150,000 to $175,000 in cash following December 31, 2021. In addition, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of Fyber, we must pay the tender offer consideration in cash and make a potential earn-out payment of up to $50,000, which may be paid in shares of our common stock or, under certain circumstances, in cash. On April 29, 2021, we entered into the New Credit Agreement and borrowed approximately $107,000 on the revolver on that date, and we borrowed an additional $130,000 on the revolver on May 25, 2021 to fund the cash closing payments for the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions. In order to fund the future cash payments due in respect of the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, we will need to use cash flows from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and may need to access the capital markets. If our cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not available for any reason, we would need to seek funds from the capital markets. 62 Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contingencies, litigation, and goodwill and intangible assets acquired from our acquisitions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Basis of Presentation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for annual financial statements. The financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the Company for each period presented. Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. Carriers and OEMs As discussed above, contracts with carriers and OEMs are created to help the customer control, manage, and monetize the mobile device through the marketing of application slots or advertisement space/inventory to advertisers and delivering the applications or advertisements to the mobile device. The Company generally offers these services under a revenue share model or, to a lesser extent, a customer contract per-device license fee model for a two-to-four year software as a service (""SaaS"") license agreement. These agreements typically include the following services: the access to a SaaS platform, hosting, solution features, and general support and maintenance. The Company has concluded that each promised service is delivered concurrently, interdependently, and continuously with all other promised services over the contract term and, as such, has concluded these promises are a single performance obligation that is delivered to the customer over a series of distinct service periods over the contract term. The Company meets the criteria for overtime recognition because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs, and the same method would be used to measure progress over each distinct service period. The fees for such services are not known at contract inception, but are measurable during each distinct service period. The Company's contracts do not include advance non-refundable fees. The Company’s fees for these services are based upon a revenue-share arrangement with the carrier or OEM. Both parties have agreed to share the revenue earned from third-party advertisers, discussed below, for these services. 63 Third-Party Advertisers Application Management Software The Company generally offers these services under customer contract Cost-Per-Install or CPI arrangements, Cost-Per-Placement or CPP arrangements, and/or Cost-Per-Action or CPA arrangements with third-party advertisers and developers, as well as advertising aggregators, generally in the form of insertion orders that specify the type of arrangement (as detailed above) at particular set budget amounts/restraints. These advertiser customer contracts are generally short-term in nature, at less than one year, as the budget amounts are typically spent in full within this time period. These agreements typically include the delivery of applications to home screens of mobile devices. Access to inventory of application slots is allocated by carriers or OEMs in the contracts identified above. The Company controls these application slots and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the application to the device. Revenue recognition related to CPI and CPA arrangements is dependent upon an action of the end user. As a result, the transaction price is variable and is fully constrained until an install or action occurs. Programmatic Advertising and Targeted Media Delivery The Company generally offers these services under cost-per-thousand impression arrangements and page-view arrangements. Through its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company markets ad space/inventory within its content products for display advertising. The ad space/inventory is allocated to the Company through arrangement with the carrier or OEM in the contracts discussed above. The Company controls this ad space/inventory and markets it on behalf of the carriers and OEMs to the advertisers. The Company’s advertising customers can bid on each individual display ad and the highest bid wins the right to fill each ad impression. Advertising agencies acting on the behalf of advertisers bid on the ad placement via the Company’s advertising exchange customers. When the bid is won, the ad will be received and placed on the mobile device by the Company. The entire process happens almost instantaneously and on a continuous basis. The advertising exchanges bill and collect from the winning bidders and provide daily and monthly reports of the activity to the Company. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time upon delivery of the advertisement to the device based on the impressions or page-view arrangement, as defined in the contract. Through its mobile phone first screen applications and mobile web portals, the Company’s software platform also recommends sponsored content to mobile phone users and drives web traffic to a customer's website. The Company markets this content to content sponsors, such as Outbrain or Taboola, similarly to the marketing of ad space/inventory. This sponsored content takes the form of articles, graphics, pictures, and similar content. The Company has concluded that the performance obligation within the contract is complete upon delivery of the content to the mobile device. Gross vs Net Reporting The Company has determined that it is the primary obligor for its advertiser services for application management and programmatic advertising and targeted media delivery when it controls the application slots or ad space/inventory. This is because it has been allocated such slots or space from the carrier or OEM and is responsible for marketing or monetizing the slots or space. The advertisers look to the Company to acquire such slots or space, and the Company’s software is used to deliver the applications, ads or content to the mobile device. The Company also may manage application or ad campaigns of advertisers associated with these services. If the applications or advertisements are not delivered to the mobile device or the Company doesn’t comply with certain policies of the advertiser, the Company would be responsible and have to indemnify the customer for these issues. The Company also has discretion in setting the price of the slots or space based on market conditions, collects the transaction prices, and remits the revenue-share percentage of the transaction price to the carrier or OEM. The Company recognizes the transaction price received from advertisers, content providers, or websites gross and the carrier or OEM share of such transaction price as costs of revenues - license fees and revenue share - in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income / (Loss). The carrier or OEM may have the right to market and sell application slots or ad space to advertisers using the Company’s software. The carrier or OEM will share revenue with the Company when it does so. The Company recognizes the revenue shared by the carrier or OEM on a net basis as the Company is not considered the primary obligor in these transactions. 64 Allowance for Credit Losses The Company maintains reserves for current expected credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Software Development Costs The Company applies the principles of FASB ASC 985-20, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (“ASC 985-20”). ASC 985-20 requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale, software development costs must be capitalized and reported at the lower of the unamortized cost or net realizable value of the related product. At this time, we do not invest significant capital into the research and development phase of new products and features as the technological feasibility aspect of our platform products has either already been met or is met very quickly. The Company has adopted the “tested working model” approach to establishing technological feasibility for its products. Under this approach, the Company does not consider a product in development to have passed the technological feasibility milestone until the Company has completed a model of the product that contains essentially all the functionality and features of the final product and has tested the model to ensure that it works as expected. The Company considers the following factors in determining whether costs can be capitalized: the emerging nature of the mobile market; the gradual evolution of the wireless carrier platforms and devices for which it develops products; the lack of pre-orders or sales history for its products; the uncertainty regarding a product’s revenue-generating potential; its lack of control over the carrier distribution channel resulting in uncertainty as to when, if ever, a product will be available for sale; and its historical practice of canceling products at any stage of the development process. After products and features are released, all product maintenance cost are expensed. The Company also applies the principles of FASB ASC 350-40, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (“ASC 350-40”). ASC 350-40 requires that software development costs incurred before the preliminary project stage be expensed as incurred. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the functions intended. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASC 740-10”), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in its financial statements or tax returns. Under ASC 740-10, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, along with net operating losses, if it is more likely than not the tax benefits will be realized using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. To the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized, a valuation allowance is established, if necessary. The Company is required to evaluate its ability to realize its deferred tax assets using all available evidence, both positive and negative, and determine if a valuation allowance is needed. Further, ASC 740-10-30-18 outlines the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards. The sources of taxable income are listed below from least to most subjective: • Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences • Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards • Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law • Tax-planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example: ◦ Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards ◦ Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss ◦ Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments 65 ASC 740-10 prescribes that a company should use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company’s income is subject to taxation in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company establishes reserves for income tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when the Company believes that positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company adjusts uncertain tax liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax liabilities and changes in liabilities that are considered appropriate. Stock-Based Compensation We have applied FASB ASC 718, Share-Based Payment (“ASC 718”), and, accordingly, we record stock-based compensation expense for all of our stock-based awards. Under ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. The amount of expense recognized represents the expense associated with the stock options we expect to vest, based on an estimated rate of forfeitures. This rate of forfeitures is updated, as necessary, and any adjustments needed to recognize the fair value of options that vest or are forfeited are recorded. The Black-Scholes model, used to estimate the fair value of an award, requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, interest rates, dividend rates, and an option’s expected life. As a result, the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments for the expenses recognized for stock-based compensation. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and acquired trade names from a market participant perspective. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 350-20, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , the value assigned to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is not amortized to expense, but rather they are evaluated, at least on an annual basis, to determine if there are potential impairments. For goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, we complete what is referred to as the “Step 0” analysis, which involves evaluating qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance. If our “Step 0” analysis indicates it is more likely than not the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we would perform a quantitative two-step impairment test. 66 The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of our reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts and an impairment loss is recognized equivalent to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, market multiples, or appraised values, as appropriate. Discounted cash flow analysis requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company’s businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset valuation process include: the timing and amount of projected future cash flows; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal or regulatory trends. In the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of goodwill. See Note ""Goodwill"" to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In performing the related valuation analyses, the Company used various valuation methodologies including probability-weighted discounted cash flows, comparable transaction analysis, and market capitalization and comparable company multiple comparison. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements are detailed in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.","Digital Turbine, Inc. (“DTI”)
Digital Turbine, Inc., through its subsidiaries, simplifies content discovery and delivers it directly to mobile devices. Its on-device media platform powers frictionless application and content discovery, user acquisition and engagement, operational efficiency, and monetization opportunities. Through March 31, 2021, DTI’s technology platform has been adopted by over 35 mobile operators and device original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") and has delivered more than 5.3 billion application preloads for tens of thousands of advertising campaigns. The Company operates this business as one operating and reportable segment - Media Distribution and the reportable segment Advertising.
The Company's Media Distribution business consists of products and services that simplify the discovery and delivery of mobile applications and content media for consumers.
With global headquarters in Austin, Texas and offices in Durham, North Carolina; San Francisco, California; Arlington, Virginia; São Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Singapore; and Tel Aviv, Israel, Digital Turbine’s solutions are available worldwide.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, revenues increased $174,864, or 126.1%, compared to the prior year.
DTI’s Media Distribution business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory. During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Media Distribution business, primarily through silent application delivery, was the main driver of DTI’s revenues. Application Media revenue totaled $217,447 and $133,898, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, while Content Media revenue, primarily related to the Mobile Posse acquisition on February 28, 2020, totaled $96,132 and $4,817, respectively. The increase in net revenues of $83,549 related to the Company’s Application Media business was attributable to increased demand for its core services, and expanded platform offerings, which led to higher CPI and CPP revenue per available placement. Of this increase in Application Media revenue, approximately $59,900 is related to increases in demand for the company’s core services, and approximately $23,649 is related to new and expanded platform offerings. The increase in net revenues of $91,315 related to DTI’s Content Media business, primarily from the acquisition of Mobile Posse, is a function of a full year of contribution in the current fiscal year, as opposed to one month of contribution in the previous fiscal year, as well as post acquisition technology synergies driving expansion across the existing Digital Turbine partner base.
Total costs of revenues and operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $254,370 and $125,503, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately $128,867 or 102.7%. This change is a result of continued growth including the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate. Company-wide cost control measures show the DTI’s ability to scale revenues at a greater rate than operating expenses.
Total interest and other income / (expense), net, for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(17,352) and $(9,307), respectively, an increase in net expenses of $8,045 or 86.4%. This change in total interest and other income / (expense), net, was primarily attributable to changes in interest income / (expense), fair value of warrant liability, and estimated contingent consideration related to the Mobile Posse acquisition.
DTI’s primary sources of liquidity have historically been issuances of common and preferred stock, debt, and cash from operations. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $31,118.
DTI anticipates that its primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash-on-hand, cash provided by operations, and the credit available under the Company's senior credit facility. In addition, the Company may raise additional capital through future equity or, subject to restrictions contained in the Company's senior credit facility, debt financing to finance the future purchase price and earn-out payment obligations with respect to the AdColony and Fyber acquisitions, provide for greater flexibility to make acquisitions, make new investments in under-capitalized opportunities, or invest in organic opportunities.
At March 31, 2021, there was $15,000 outstanding principal on the BoA Credit Agreement and the Company had $85,000 available to draw. Subsequent to year end, on April 29, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., which provides for a revolving line of credit of $400,000 to be used for working capital, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other lawful corporate purposes. This modification replaced the existing BoA Credit Agreement. The revolving line of credit matures on April 29, 2026.
During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the DTI’s net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $62,795 and $33,670, respectively, an increase of $29,125, or 86.5%. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $54,884 offset by net non-cash expenses of $13,340. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by the net change in working capital accounts as of March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020, with a net increase over the comparative periods in current liabilities of $32,456 offset by an increase in current assets of approximately $24,540.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was approximately $37,808, which includes capital expenditures of $9,204, comprised mostly of internally-developed software, and the acquisition of Appreciate, net of cash, for $20,348.
During the year ended March 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was approximately $15,216, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings of $15,000 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of approximately $7,209, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $469, payment of contingent consideration of $16,956, and repayment of debt obligations of $20,000.

"GENERAL For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the fiscal year, we believe our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&amp;A”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report as indexed on page F-1. Comparisons under this heading refer to the 53-week period ended October 3, 2021 and 52-week period ended September 27, 2020 for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. A comparison of our results of operations and cash flows for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020. Our MD&amp;A consists of the following sections: • Overview — a general description of our business and fiscal 2021 highlights. • Results of Operations — an analysis of our consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. • Liquidity and Capital Resources — an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, share repurchase activity, dividends, and known trends that may impact liquidity. • Critical Accounting Estimates — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. We have included in our MD&amp;A certain performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance and which we believe will be useful in analyzing and understanding our results of operations. These metrics include: • Changes in sales at restaurants open more than one year (“same-store sales”), system restaurant sales, franchised restaurant sales, and average unit volumes (“AUVs”). Same-store sales, restaurant sales, and AUVs are presented for franchised restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at franchise restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. We believe franchise and system same-store sales, franchised and system-wide sales, and AUV information are useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the Company’s profitability. • Adjusted EBITDA represents net earnings on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis excluding gains or losses from discontinued operations, income taxes, interest expense, net, gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants, impairment and other (gains) charges, net, depreciation and amortization, amortization of tenant improvement allowances and other, and pension settlement charges. We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the Company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations within MD&amp;A, provides useful information about operating performance and period-over-period change, and provides additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA permits investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Same-store sales, system restaurant sales, franchised restaurant sales, AUVs, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to earnings from operations, or other similarly titled measures of other companies. OVERVIEW Our Business As of October 3, 2021, we operated and franchised 2,218 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including one in Guam. We derive revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and contributions for advertising and other services from franchisees. In addition, we recognize gains or losses from the sale of company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which are included as a line item within operating costs and expenses, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. 26 Impact of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have varying degrees of disruption on our business. Throughout the pandemic substantially all of our restaurants have remained open, with the majority of our dining rooms closed and locations operating in an off-premise capacity, leveraging our drive-thru, carryout and delivery capabilities. We have continued to follow the guidance of expert health authorities to ensure precautionary steps are taken to protect the health and safety of our employees and guests. Our drive-thru, carryout, and delivery capabilities have positioned us to continue our strong systemwide sales growth in 2021; however, our business has been challenged by COVID-19 related labor availability and wage inflation. As a result of labor challenges, we and our franchisees have had to reduce hours of operations and keep dining rooms closed at certain locations. While we have not had significant disruptions in our supply chain, we have experienced some product shortages and higher costs and inflationary pressures. The pandemic has affected consumer behavior with increased focus on digital sales. We have seen significant growth in our digital sales and continue to support enhancements of our digital ordering and off-premise channels, such as delivery. While we do not know the future impact COVID-19 will have on our business, we expect labor and supply chain challenges and inflation to continue into at least fiscal 2022. Other Developments As previously announced, a franchisee that operated 68 restaurants in the Midwest filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2021. Of the 68 restaurants, we sublease 50 of the locations to the franchisee and own the land and building for the remaining 18 locations. Through the bankruptcy proceedings, the franchisee may reject the franchise agreements and leases for a number of these locations, resulting in potential impairment costs related to future lease obligations. On May 5, 2021 the franchisee filed a motion with the court rejecting three of the locations, two of which were permanently closed in fiscal 2020. On August 26, 2021, in response to a subsequent motion to reject two additional locations, the court authorized such rejections as of the dates previously agreed upon by the parties. On November 15, 2021, the franchisee filed an additional motion with the court rejected a total of 5 more locations. The franchisee’s remaining restaurants continue to operate with the franchisee remaining current with their obligations to us. The Company does not expect to acquire and operate any restaurants as part of the sale of these restaurants and our current expectation is the remaining restaurants will be transferred to one or more other franchise partners. Financial Highlights for Fiscal 2021 • Systemwide sales for the year increased 13.1% as compared to 2020. The increase is inclusive of the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental systemwide sales of $77.9 million. Excluding the 53rd week, systemwide sales in fiscal 2021 increased 11.0%. • System same-store sales for the year increased 10.3%. • Total revenues for the year increased 12.0%. The increase is inclusive of the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental revenue of approximately $21.3 million. • Earnings from operations for the year increased 25.7%. • Net earnings and Diluted EPS increased 84.7% and 90.9%, respectively. • Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2021 to $331.4 million from $274.2 million, or 21%. The increase is inclusive of the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental Adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million. • Net units down 1.0% with 37 closures and 14 store openings during the year. 27 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2021 AND 2020 The following table presents certain income and expense items included in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of total revenues, unless otherwise indicated. Percentages may not add due to rounding. ________________________ (1) As a percentage of company restaurant sales. (2) As a percentage of franchise rental revenues. (3) As a percentage of franchise royalties and other. (4) As a percentage of franchise contributions for advertising and other services. (5) As a percentage of earnings from continuing operations and before income taxes. The following table summarizes changes in same-store sales for company-operated, franchised, and system restaurants: The following table summarizes the changes in the number and mix of company and franchise restaurants: 28 The following table summarizes the restaurant sales for company-operated, franchised, and total systemwide restaurants (in thousands) : ________________________ (1) Franchised restaurant sales represent sales at franchised restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. System sales include company and franchised restaurant sales. We do not record franchised sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised sales. We believe franchised and system restaurant sales information is useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the Company's profitability. Below is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings (in thousands) : Company Restaurant Operations The following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands) : Company restaurant sales increased $38.8 million, or 11.1%, in 2021 as compared with the prior year. In 2021, the increase was primarily driven by average check growth, menu price increases, an increase in the average number of restaurants and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by a decline in traffic. The following table presents the approximate impact of these items on company restaurant sales in 2021 ( in millions ): 29 Same-store sales at company-operated restaurants increased 6.1% in 2021 compared to a year ago. The following table summarizes the increases (decreases) in company-operated same-store sales: ________________________ (1) Includes price increases of 3.5% in 2021. Food and packaging costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased by 0.3% to 29.1% in 2021 from 29.4% a year ago, primarily due to favorable sales mix of 0.8% and menu price increases of 0.9%, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in commodities. Commodity costs increased in the current fiscal year by approximately 5.1% primarily due to increases in pork and beverages. For fiscal 2022, we expect annual commodity cost inflation to be up 6% to 7% compared with fiscal 2021. Payroll and employee benefit costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased to 30.7% in 2021 compared with 30.5% a year ago primarily due to labor inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and a change in the mix of restaurants due to franchisee acquisitions. Labor inflation was approximately 7.2% in the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, we expect annual wage inflation to be up 8% to 10% compared with fiscal 2021. Occupancy and other costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased to 15.9% in 2021 from 15.5% a year ago due primarily to higher costs for delivery fees as we grow our delivery sales mix, higher costs for utilities and the acquisition of 20 restaurants with lower than average sales volumes; partially offset by leverage from higher same-store sales. Franchise Operations The following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each fiscal year and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in franchise operating results ( dollars in thousands ): ________________________ (1) 2021 AUV is adjusted to exclude the 53rd week for the purpose of comparison to prior year. Franchise rental revenues increased $26.0 million, or 8.1%, in 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher AUVs resulting in an increase in revenues from percentage rent. In 2021, additional rent revenue of approximately $6.5 million from a 53rd week also contributed to the increase. Franchise royalties and other increased $26.4 million, or 14.8%, primarily due to higher royalties of $22.5 million as a result of higher AUVs and additional royalties of approximately $3.6 million from a 53rd week. Additionally, fees received in connection with the early termination of franchise agreements increased by $3.3 million. 30 Franchise contributions for advertising and other services increased $31.0 million, or 17.9%, primarily due to higher marketing contributions of $29.9 million, as a result of higher AUVs, additional contributions of approximately $3.5 million from a 53rd week, and a reduction in contribution percentages for March 2020 and April 2020 marketing fees in response to the pandemic which contributed to lower fees of $7.9 million in the prior year. Franchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $4.9 million in 2021, primarily due to additional costs of approximately $4.0 million from a 53rd week. Franchise support and other costs remained flat in 2021, primarily to lower bad debt expense of $1.7 million related to specific franchise situations that occurred in the prior year, offset by higher costs related to a franchise business conference and brand standard audits. Franchise advertising and other service expenses increased $29.5 million, or 16.3% in 2021 primarily due to an increase in marketing contributions of $29.9 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $6.3 million in 2021 as compared with the prior year, primarily due to certain of our franchise building assets becoming fully depreciated. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&amp;A”) Expenses The following table presents the increase (decrease) in SG&amp;A expenses in 2021 compared with the prior year ( in thousands ): Advertising costs represent company contributions to our marketing fund and are generally determined as a percentage of company-operated restaurant sales. Advertising costs, on a comparable 52-week basis, increased $2.1 million primarily due to higher company-operated restaurant sales and a decrease in the contribution percentage in the prior year. Incentive compensation increased by $2.6 million in 2021 primarily due to higher achievement levels compared to the prior year for the Company’s annual incentive plan, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of turnover at the executive level in the prior year. The cash surrender value of our Company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies, are subject to market fluctuations. The changes in market values had a positive impact of $6.2 million versus the prior year as a result of $9.1 million of gains recognized in the year compared to $2.9 million of gains in the prior year. Litigation matters increased by $1.2 million in 2021 primarily due to a $3.8 million favorable settlement received in the prior year from a class action lawsuit related to credit card interchange fees, partially offset by $2.6 million lower costs on certain employee and other litigation matters. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Insurance costs decreased $1.4 million in 2021 versus the prior year primarily due to more favorable trends in the current year related to expected losses associated with workers’ compensation claims. 31 Impairment and Other Gains, Net Impairment and other gains, net is comprised of the following ( in thousands ): Impairment and other gains, net decreased $3.1 million in 2021 versus the prior year primarily due to lower gains on the disposition of property and equipment of $2.9 million. In 2021, gains related to the sale of restaurant properties versus a gain on the sale of one of our corporate office buildings in the prior year. Refer to Note 9, Impairment and Other (Gains) Charges, Net, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Gains on the Sale of Company-Operated Restaurants In 2021 and 2020, no company-operated restaurants were sold to franchisees. Gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants in both periods pertain to meeting certain contingent consideration provisions included in restaurants sold in previous years. Other Pension and Post-Retirement Expenses, Net Other pension and post-retirement expenses, net decreased by $40.8 million in 2021 versus the prior year, primarily due to non-cash pension settlement charges of $39.2 million in the prior year. Refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these charges. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net, is comprised of the following ( in thousands ): Interest expense, net, increased $0.7 million in 2021 primarily due to interest from the 53rd contributing an additional $1.2 million and lower interest income of $0.4 million; partially offset by lower average borrowings as a result of paying down our Variable Funding Notes in 2021. Income Taxes The income tax provisions reflect effective tax rates of 25.2% and 26.8% in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The major components of the year-over-year change in tax rates were a decrease in the impact of non-deductible compensation for certain officers, a decrease in nondeductible costs resulting from a California Private Attorney General Act lawsuit settled in the prior year, and an increase in non-taxable gains from the market performance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans, partially offset by an adjustment to state taxes recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our securitized financing facility. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service requirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to our benefit plans. We generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our Variable Funding Notes. As of October 3, 2021, the Company had $73.6 million of cash and restricted cash on its balance sheet and $110.5 million of borrowing availability under its Variable Funding Notes. Based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing facility including our Variable Funding Notes, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 32 Cash Flows The table below summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations activities for each of the last two fiscal years ( in thousands ): Operating Activities . Operating cash flows increased $57.6 million compared with a year ago, primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $27.4 million and favorable changes in working capital of $30.2 million, primarily due to a favorable change in accounts receivable of $32.9 million, as a result of the repayment of franchise marketing and rent deferrals provided in the prior year, a favorable change in accrued liabilities of $24.8 million mainly from an increase in deferred rent income driven by collections of October rent in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021; partially offset by an unfavorable change in operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $25.3 million due to payment of October rent in the 53rd week and the repayment of deferrals we received from our landlords in the prior year. Pension and Postretirement Contributions — Our policy is to fund our pension plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of the date of our last actuarial funding valuation for our qualified pension plan, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement. In 2021 and 2020, we contributed $6.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, to our pension and postretirement plans. We do not anticipate making any contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2022. For additional information, refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Investing Activities . Cash flows used in investing activities increased $50.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $21.5 million higher capital expenditures, $15.9 million lower proceeds on sale and leaseback transactions, and $11.0 million lower proceeds received on the sale of property and equipment, primarily due to proceeds received on the sale of a corporate office building in the prior year. Capital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each fiscal year is summarized in the table below ( in thousands ): In 2021, capital expenditures increased by $21.5 million compared to a year ago primarily due to a $15.1 million increase in purchases of assets intended for sale and leaseback. In 2021 and 2020, we exercised our right of first refusal related to six and one leased restaurant properties, respectively. 33 We use sale and leaseback financing to lower the initial cash investment in our restaurants to the cost of the equipment, whenever possible. The following table summarizes the cash flow activity related to these transactions in each fiscal year ( dollars in thousands ): Financing Activities . Cash flows used in financing activities increased by $256.3 million compared with a year ago, primarily due to our repayment during the second quarter of $107.9 million of 2020 borrowings on our Variable Funding Notes and an increase in stock repurchases of $44.4 million. Repurchases of Common Stock — In fiscal 2021, the Company purchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $200.0 million. As of October 3, 2021, there was no remaining amount under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On November 19, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $200.0 million stock buy-back program that expires on November 20, 2023. Dividends — In fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share in the first and second quarter and $0.44 per share in the third and fourth quarter, totaling $37.6 million. Future dividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Long-Term Debt — As of October 3, 2021, our long-term debt consists of $1,290.3 million of total principal outstanding on the Class A-2 Notes (as defined below). Given the uncertainty arising from COVID-19, we took a precautionary measure and borrowed $107.9 under the Variable Funding Notes during the second quarter of 2020, which was fully repaid in the second quarter of 2021. As of October 3, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and $110.5 million of available borrowing capacity under our Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $39.5 million. On July 8, 2019, Jack in the Box Funding, LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed its securitization transaction and issued $575.0 million of its Series 2019-1 3.982% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”), $275.0 million of its Series 2019-1 4.476% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes”) and $450.0 million of its Series 2019-1 4.970% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III (the “Class A-2-III Notes”) and together with the Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes, (the “Class A-2 Notes”), in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2019-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the “Notes.” Interest and principal payments on the Class A-2 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of $3.25 million on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. In 2021, the Company’s actual leverage ratio was under 5.0x, and as a result, quarterly principal payments were not required. The legal final maturity date of the Class A-2 Notes is in August 2049, but it is expected that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the anticipated repayment dates of the Class A-2-I Notes, the Class A-2-II Notes and the Class A-2-III Notes will be August 2023, August 2026, and August 2029, respectively (the “Anticipated Repayment Dates”). If the Master Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the Class A-2 Notes prior to the respective anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue pursuant to the Indenture. Restricted Cash — In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee for the benefit of the note holders and are restricted in their use. As of October 3, 2021, the Master Issuer had restricted cash of $18.2 million, which primarily represented cash collections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of interest and commitment fees required for the Class A-1 and A-2 Notes. 34 Covenants and Restrictions — The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments. As of October 3, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenant requirements and were not subject to any rapid amortization events. Contractual Obligations Our cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments include: Debt Obligations and Interest Payments — Refer to Note 7, Indebtedness , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information of our obligations and the timing of expected payments. Operating and Finance Leases — Refer to Note 8, Leases, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information of our obligations and the timing of expected payments. Purchase Commitments — Purchase obligations includes non-cancelable purchase commitments related to information technology agreements and volume commitments for beverage products. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies , for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. Benefit Obligations — Refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our obligations and the timing of expected payments under our non-qualified defined benefit plan and postretirement healthcare plans. 35 DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Long-lived Assets — We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy proceedings or other significant financial distress of a lessee, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, significant changes in our business and/or negative industry or economic trends, or our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of related undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss by the amount that the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair value. Our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in our business plans, operating performance, and economic conditions. Self-Insurance — We are self-insured for a portion of our losses related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other legal claims, and health benefits. In estimating our self-insurance accruals, we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses and assumptions related to the loss development factors, which are based on statistical analysis of historical data. These assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what was estimated, or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected, accruals might not be sufficient, and additional expense may be recorded. Legal Accruals — The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. A determination of the amount accrued, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter. We continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. As a result, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from those estimates. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.","As of October 3, 2021, the company operated and franchised 2,218 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including one in Guam. The company derives revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and contributions for advertising and other services from franchisees. In addition, the company recognizes gains or losses from the sale of company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which are included as a line item within operating costs and expenses, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

•Earnings from operations for the year increased 25.7%.
•Net earnings and Diluted EPS increased 84.7% and 90.9%, respectively.
•Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2021 to $331.4 million from $274.2 million, or 21%. The increase is inclusive of the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental Adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million.
•Net units down 1.0% with 37 closures and 14 store openings during the year.

Franchise rental revenues increased $26.0 million, or 8.1%, in 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher AUVs resulting in an increase in revenues from percentage rent. In 2021, additional rent revenue of approximately $6.5 million from a 53rd week also contributed to the increase.
Franchise royalties and other increased $26.4 million, or 14.8%, primarily due to higher royalties of $22.5 million as a result of higher AUVs and additional royalties of approximately $3.6 million from a 53rd week. Additionally, fees received in connection with the early termination of franchise agreements increased by $3.3 million.

Franchise contributions for advertising and other services increased $31.0 million, or 17.9%, primarily due to higher marketing contributions of $29.9 million, as a result of higher AUVs, additional contributions of approximately $3.5 million from a 53rd week, and a reduction in contribution percentages for March 2020 and April 2020 marketing fees in response to the pandemic which contributed to lower fees of $7.9 million in the prior year.
Franchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $4.9 million in 2021, primarily due to additional costs of approximately $4.0 million from a 53rd week.
Franchise support and other costs remained flat in 2021, primarily to lower bad debt expense of $1.7 million related to specific franchise situations that occurred in the prior year, offset by higher costs related to a franchise business conference and brand standard audits.
Franchise advertising and other service expenses increased $29.5 million, or 16.3% in 2021 primarily due to an increase in marketing contributions of $29.9 million.
Interest expense, net, increased $0.7 million in 2021 primarily due to interest from the 53rd contributing an additional $1.2 million and lower interest income of $0.4 million; partially offset by lower average borrowings as a result of paying down the company's Variable Funding Notes in 2021.
The company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its securitized financing facility. The company’s cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service requirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to the company's benefit plans. The company generally reinvests available cash flows from operations to invest in its business, service the company's debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of the company's common stock.
The company’s primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the company's Variable Funding Notes. As of October 3, 2021, the Company had $73.6 million of cash and restricted cash on its balance sheet and $110.5 million of borrowing availability under its Variable Funding Notes.
Operating cash flows increased $57.6 million compared with a year ago, primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $27.4 million and favorable changes in working capital of $30.2 million, primarily due to a favorable change in accounts receivable of $32.9 million, as a result of the repayment of franchise marketing and rent deferrals provided in the prior year, a favorable change in accrued liabilities of $24.8 million mainly from an increase in deferred rent income driven by collections of October rent in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021; partially offset by an unfavorable change in operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $25.3 million due to payment of October rent in the 53rd week and the repayment of deferrals the company received from the company's landlords in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities increased $50.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $21.5 million higher capital expenditures, $15.9 million lower proceeds on sale and leaseback transactions, and $11.0 million lower proceeds received on the sale of property and equipment, primarily due to proceeds received on the sale of a corporate office building in the prior year.
In 2021, capital expenditures increased by $21.5 million compared to a year ago primarily due to a $15.1 million increase in purchases of assets intended for sale and leaseback. In 2021 and 2020, the company exercised the company's right of first refusal related to six and one leased restaurant properties, respectively. The company uses sale and leaseback financing to lower the initial cash investment in the company's restaurants to the cost of the equipment, whenever possible.

Cash flows used in financing activities increased by $256.3 million compared with a year ago, primarily due to the company's repayment during the second quarter of $107.9 million of 2020 borrowings on the company's Variable Funding Notes and an increase in stock repurchases of $44.4 million.
As of October 3, 2021, the company’s long-term debt consists of $1,290.3 million of total principal outstanding on the Class A-2 Notes. Given the uncertainty arising from COVID-19, the company took a precautionary measure and borrowed $107.9 under the Variable Funding Notes during the second quarter of 2020, which was fully repaid in the second quarter of 2021. As of October 3, 2021, the company had no outstanding borrowings and $110.5 million of available borrowing capacity under the company's Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $39.5 million.
On July 8, 2019, Jack in the Box Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed its securitization transaction and issued $575.0 million of its Series 2019-1 3.982% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I, $275.0 million of its Series 2019-1 4.476% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II and $450.0 million of its Series 2019-1 4.970% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III and together with the Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes, in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2019-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1, which allows for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit.
Interest and principal payments on the Class A-2 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of $3.25 million on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. In 2021, the Company’s actual leverage ratio was under 5.0x, and as a result, quarterly principal payments were not required.
The legal final maturity date of the Class A-2 Notes is in August 2049, but it is expected that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the anticipated repayment dates of the Class A-2-I Notes, the Class A-2-II Notes and the Class A-2-III Notes will be August 2023, August 2026, and August 2029, respectively. If the Master Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the Class A-2 Notes prior to the respective anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue pursuant to the Indenture.

"Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&amp;A”) includes the following: a business overview that provides a high-level summary of our strategies and initiatives, highlights from fiscal year 2021 and key performance metrics for our Software segment; a more detailed analysis of our results of operations; our capital resources and liquidity, which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments; and a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Our MD&amp;A should be read in conjunction with Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Strategies and Initiatives In fiscal 2021, our B2B scoring solutions, including the flagship FICO ® Score, continued to be the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S. In January 2020 we introduced our most predictive scores, FICO ® Score 10 and 10T . We also created the FICO ® Resilience Index, a complement to FICO Scores that identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO Score bands. We continued to develop scores that use alternative data to enhance conventional credit bureau data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers. During fiscal 2021, we continued to advance our platform-first, cloud delivered strategy in our Software segment. This led us to exit less strategic areas of our business in order to facilitate incremental investment in higher value, more strategic areas. As part of this process, we divested the non-platform-based Collections and Recovery (“C&amp;R”) business, sold all assets related to our cyber risk score operations, and sold certain assets related to our Software operations to an affiliated joint venture in China. During fiscal 2020, we changed our business practice of selling term software licenses with separate license and maintenance components to a single software subscription contract with license and maintenance bundled. This transition was substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of our fiscal 2021. The timing of our revenue recognition on these subscription sales changed, resulting in less revenue recognized upfront and more revenue recognized over the term of these subscriptions. This change led to a negative impact of our revenue recognized from term software licenses in our fiscal 2021 but does not affect total revenue recognized over the life of a contract. In addition, this change does not negatively impact our cash flows. We also continue to enhance stockholder value by returning cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs. In June 2021, following the divestiture of our C&amp;R business, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR Agreement”) to repurchase $200.0 million of our common stock. In August 2021, we entered into a stock repurchase agreement with an institutional shareholder pursuant to which we repurchased $225.0 million of our common stock. We also repurchased shares in other open market transactions under our stock repurchase programs. During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total repurchase price of $882.2 million. As of September 30, 2021, we had $173.2 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations and also the virtualization of sales and marketing events. We expect these modifications to remain in place throughout calendar year 2021, along with substantially modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other adjustments. As certain offices reopened due to the lifting of local government restrictions and a small number of employees started returning to work locations on a limited basis during fiscal 2021, we have maintained a “Voluntary Work-From-Home Policy” providing our people with valued flexibility. While we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance, including demand for our offerings, impact to our customers and partners, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Highlights from Fiscal Year 2021 • Total GAAP revenue was $1.32 billion during fiscal year 2021, a 2% increase from fiscal year 2020. • Total revenue for our Scores segment was $654.1 million during fiscal year 2021, a 24% increase from fiscal year 2020. • Annual Recurring Revenue for our Software segment as of September 30, 2021 was $524.0 million, a 6% increase from September 30, 2020, excluding divestitures. • Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate for our Software segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 106%, excluding divestitures. 32 • Cash and cash equivalents was $195.4 million as of September 30, 2021, compared with $157.4 million as of September 30, 2020. • Operating income, which included $100.1 million gains on product line asset sales and business divestiture, was $505.5 million during fiscal year 2021, a 71% increase from fiscal 2020. • Net income was $392.1 million during fiscal year 2021, a 66% increase from fiscal 2020. • Cash flow from operations was $423.8 during fiscal year 2021, compared with $364.9 million generated during the prior year. • Total debt balance was $1.268 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared with $845 million as of September 30, 2020. • $882.2 million was spent on share repurchases, compared with $235.2 million spent during the prior year. Key performance metrics for Software segment Annual Contract Value Bookings (“ACV Bookings”) Management regards ACV Bookings as an important indicator of future revenues, but they are not comparable to, nor are they a substitute for, an analysis of, our revenues. We define ACV Bookings as the average annualized value of software contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future on-premises and SaaS software revenue. We only include contracts with an initial term of at least 24 months and we exclude perpetual licenses and other revenues that are non-recurring in nature. For renewals of existing software subscription contracts, we count only incremental annual revenue expected over the current contract as ACV Bookings. ACV Bookings is calculated by dividing the total expected contract value by the contract term in years. The expected contract value equals the fixed amount — including guaranteed minimums — stated in the contract, plus estimates of future usage-based fees. We develop estimates from discussions with our customers and examinations of historical data from similar products and customer arrangements. Differences between estimates and actual results occur due to variability in the estimated usage. This variability is primarily caused by the economic trends in our customers’ industries; individual performance of our customers relative to their competitors; and regulatory and other factors that affect the business environment in which our customers operate. We disclose estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to remaining performance obligations in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. However, we believe ACV Bookings is a more meaningful measure of our business as it includes estimated revenues and future billings excluded from Note 12, such as usage-based fees and guaranteed minimums derived from our on-premises software licenses, among others. The following table summarizes our ACV Bookings during the periods indicated: (*) During fiscal 2021, we sold all assets related to our cyber risk score operations, sold certain assets related to our Software segment to an affiliated joint venture in China, and divested our C&amp;R business. The amounts above exclude these divested product lines and businesses for all periods presented. Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) Accounting Standards Codification 606 requires us to recognize a significant portion of revenue from our on-premises software subscriptions at the point in time when the software is first made available to the customer, or at the beginning of the subscription term, despite the fact that our contracts typically call for billing these amounts ratably over the life of the subscription. The remaining portion of our on-premises software subscription revenue including maintenance and usage-based fees are recognized over the life of the contract. This point-in-time recognition of a portion of our on-premises software subscription revenue creates significant variability in the revenue recognized period to period based on the timing of the subscription start date and the subscription term. Furthermore, this point-in-time revenue recognition can create a significant difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and the actual customer billing under the contract. We use ARR to measure the underlying performance of our subscription-based contracts and mitigate the impact of this variability. ARR is defined as the annualized revenue run-rate of on-premises and SaaS software agreements within a quarterly reporting period, and as such, is different from the timing and amount of revenue recognized. All components of our software licensing and subscription arrangements that are not expected to recur (primarily perpetual licenses) are excluded. We calculate ARR as the quarterly recurring revenue run-rate multiplied by four. 33 The following table summarizes our ARR at each of the dates presented: (*) During fiscal 2021, we sold all assets related to our cyber risk score operations, sold certain assets related to our Software segment to an affiliated joint venture in China, and divested our C&amp;R business. The amounts above exclude these divested product lines and businesses for all periods presented. (**) The FICO platform software is a set of interoperable services which use software assets owned and/or governed by FICO for building solutions and which conform to FICO architectural standards based on key elements of Cloud Native Computing design principles. These standards encompass shared security context and pre-integration using FICO standard application programming interfaces for all services. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate (“DBNRR”) We consider DBNRR to be an important measure of our success in retaining and growing revenue from our existing customers. To calculate DBNRR for any period, we compare the ARR at the end of the prior comparable quarter (base ARR) to the ARR from that same cohort of customers at the end of the current quarter (retained ARR); we then divide the retained ARR by the base ARR to arrive at the DBNRR. Our calculation includes the positive impact among this cohort of customers of selling additional products, price increases and increases in usage-based fees, and the negative impact of customer attrition, price decreases and decreases in usage-based fees during the period. However, the calculation does not include the positive impact from sales to any customers acquired during the period. Our DBNRR may increase or decrease from period to period as a result of various factors, including the timing of new sales and customer renewal rates. The following table summarizes our DBNRR for each of the periods presented: (*) During fiscal 2021, we sold all assets related to our cyber risk score operations, sold certain assets related to our Software segment to an affiliated joint venture in China, and divested our C&amp;R business. The amounts above exclude these divested product lines and businesses for all periods presented. 34 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are organized into the following two reportable segments: Software and Scores. Although we sell solutions and services into a large number of end user product and industry markets, our reportable business segments reflect the primary method in which management organizes and evaluates internal financial information to make operating decisions and assess performance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates performance and allocates resources, which resulted in a change from three operating segments, Applications, Decision Management Software and Scores, to two operating segments, Software and Scores, by merging Applications and Decision Management Software segments into the new Software segment. As a result, we modified the presentation of our segment financial information with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. In addition, effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services, and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services and scores on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, as well as our disclosures on disaggregation of revenue, to better align with our business strategy. Previously reported amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. Segment revenues, operating income, and related financial information, including disaggregation of revenue, for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are set forth in Note 12 and Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Revenues The following tables set forth certain summary information on a segment basis related to our revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Scores Scores segment revenues increased $125.6 million in fiscal 2021 from 2020 due to an increase of $64.6 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $61.0 million in our business-to-consumer revenue. The increase in business-to-business scores revenue was primarily attributable to a higher unit price across several business-to-business offerings, as well as higher volumes. The increase in business-to-consumer revenue was attributable to an increase in both royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through consumer reporting agencies and direct sales generated from the myFICO.com website. 35 Scores segment revenues increased $107.4 million in fiscal 2020 from 2019 due to an increase of $79.8 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $27.6 million in our business-to-consumer revenue. The increase in business-to-business scores was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage volumes, a higher unit price across several business-to-business offerings, a large royalty true-up as well as a large annual license deal recognized during fiscal 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in unsecured originations volume. The increase in business-to-consumer revenue was attributable to an increase in both royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through consumer reporting agencies and direct sales generated from the myFICO.com website. Revenues collectively generated by agreements with the three major consumer reporting agencies, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, accounted for 38%, 33% and 29% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with all three consumer reporting agencies contributing more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021, and Experian contributing more than 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019. Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in our Software segment. Software (1) Includes license portion of our on-premises subscription software and perpetual license, both of which are recognized when the software is made available to the customer, or at the start of the subscription. (2) Includes maintenance portion and usage-based fees of our on-premises subscription software, maintenance revenue on perpetual licenses, as well as SaaS revenue. Software segment revenues decreased $103.6 million in fiscal 2021 from 2020 due to a $66.7 million decrease in on-premises and SaaS software revenue and a $36.9 million decrease in services revenue. The decrease in on-premises and SaaS software revenue was attributable to a $68.6 million decrease in revenue recognized at a point in time, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in revenue recognized over time. The decrease in point-in-time recognition was primarily attributable to the shift in the timing of revenue recognition on our term license subscription sales as a result of changing our business practice of selling term licenses with separate license and maintenance components to a single software subscription contract with license and maintenance bundled, as well as a decrease in the number and size of term license deals signed or renewed during fiscal 2021. The increase in over-time recognition was primarily attributable to an increase in SaaS subscription revenue, partially offset by the divestiture of our C&amp;R business in June 2021. The decrease in services revenue was primarily due to our recent strategic shift to emphasize software over services, as well as the divestiture of our C&amp;R business. In total, $21.7 million of the year-over-year decrease in our Software segment revenue was attributable to the divestiture of our C&amp;R business. Software segment revenues increased $27.1 million in fiscal 2020 from 2019 primarily attributable to a $27.6 million increase in on-premises and SaaS software revenue, comprised of a $16.4 million increase in license portion of our on-premises subscription software and perpetual license revenue recognized at a point in time, and a $11.3 million increase in revenue recognized over time, primarily attributable to an increase in SaaS subscription revenue. 36 Operating Expenses and Other Income, Net The following tables set forth certain summary information related to our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: 37 Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of employee salaries, incentives, and benefits for personnel directly involved in delivering software products, operating SaaS infrastructure, and providing support, implementation and consulting services; allocated overhead, facilities and data center costs; software royalty fees; credit bureau data and processing services; third-party hosting fees related to our SaaS services; travel costs; and outside services. The fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease of $28.7 million in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an $18.8 million decrease in personnel and labor costs, a $9.2 million decrease in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs and a $3.7 million decrease in travel costs, partially offset by an increase in direct materials costs. The decreases in personnel and labor costs, and in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs were both largely driven by our strategic cost initiative implemented in September 2020, in which we reduced our workforce, consolidated office space and abandoned certain property and equipment; as well as the divestiture of our C&amp;R business in June 2021. The decrease in travel costs was primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in direct materials costs was primarily attributable to increased third-party data costs related to increased Scores revenue. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 25% during fiscal 2021 from 28% during fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased sales of our higher-margin Scores products. The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase of $24.3 million in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an $11.1 million increase in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs, a $10.3 million increase in personnel and labor costs and a $7.6 million increase in direct materials cost, partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in travel costs. The increase in facilities and infrastructure costs was primarily attributable to increased resource requirements due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations. The increase in personnel and labor costs was primarily attributable to an increase in our average headcount. The increase in direct materials cost was primarily attributable to an increase in license and Scores revenues that incur third-party royalties and data costs, as well as an increase in telecommunication cost. The decrease in travel costs was primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 28% during fiscal 2020, materially consistent with that incurred during fiscal 2019. Research and Development Research and development expenses include personnel and related overhead costs incurred in the development of new products and services, including research of mathematical and statistical models and development of new versions of software products. The fiscal 2021 over 2020 increase of $4.7 million in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs, driven by increased average headcount and our continued investments in new product development. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 13% during fiscal 2021, consistent with that during fiscal 2020. 38 The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase of $17.0 million in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs and an increase in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs, both driven by increased average headcount and our continued investments in new product development. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 13% during fiscal 2020, consistent with that incurred during fiscal 2019. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee salaries, incentives, commissions and benefits; travel costs; overhead costs; advertising and other promotional expenses; corporate facilities expenses; legal expenses; and business development expenses. The fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $24.6 million was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million decrease in travel costs, a $6.8 million decrease in marketing costs, a $5.0 million decrease in outside services, and a $4.6 million decrease in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs. The decrease in travel costs was a result of a decrease in travel activity due to COVID-19. The decrease in marketing costs was primarily driven by a company-wide marketing event during fiscal 2020. The decrease in outside services was attributable to a decrease in legal and consulting fees associated with several company initiatives during fiscal 2020. The decrease in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs was largely driven by our strategic cost initiative implemented in September 2020, in which we consolidated office space and abandoned certain property and equipment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 30% during fiscal 2021 from 33% during fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased sales of our high-margin Scores products. The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase of $6.8 million was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased average headcount, higher share-based compensation and higher non-capitalizable commission cost. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in marketing and travel costs as a result of a decrease in travel activity due to COVID-19. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 33% during fiscal 2020 from 35% during fiscal 2019 primarily due to increased sales of our high-margin Scores and software products. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets consists of expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions. Our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of completed technology and customer contracts and relationships, which are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from four to fifteen years. Amortization expense was $3.3 million, $5.0 million and $6.1 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Restructuring and Impairment Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we incurred charges of $8.0 million in employee separation costs due to the elimination of 160 positions throughout the Company. Cash payments for all the employee separation costs will be paid by the end of our fiscal 2022. There were no impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we incurred net charges totaling $45.0 million consisting of $28.0 million in impairment loss on operating lease assets, $5.2 million in impairment loss on abandonment of property and equipment and $11.8 million in restructuring charges. The impairment losses were associated with closing certain non-core offices and reducing office space in other locations to better align with anticipated needs in light of post-pandemic workforce patterns. The restructuring charges related to employee separation costs as a result of eliminating 209 positions throughout the Company. Cash payments for all the employee separation costs were fully paid before the end of our fiscal 2021. There were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal 2019. Gains on Product Line Asset Sales and Business Divestiture The $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and business divestiture during fiscal 2021 was attributable to a $92.8 million gain on the sale of the C&amp;R business in June 2021, a $7.3 million gain on the sale of all assets related to our cyber risk score operations in October 2020, and the sale of certain assets related to our Software operations to an affiliated joint venture in China in December 2020. 39 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in December 2019, May 2018, and July 2010 (which July 2010 senior notes were paid in full at maturity in July 2020), as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit. On our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, interest expense is netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements. The fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease in net interest expense of $2.1 million was primarily attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase in net interest expense of $2.4 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2020. Other Income, Net Other income, net consists primarily of realized investment gains/losses and unrealized gains/losses on certain investments classified as trading securities, exchange rate gains/losses resulting from re-measurement of foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances held by our various reporting entities into their respective functional currencies at period-end market rates, net of the impact of offsetting foreign currency forward contracts, and other non-operating items. The fiscal 2021 over 2020 increase in other income, net of $4.5 million was primarily attributable to an increase in net unrealized gains on our supplemental retirement and savings plan, as well as a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses. The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase in other income, net of $0.9 million was primarily attributable to an increase in net unrealized gains on our supplemental retirement and savings plan, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 17.1%, 8.0% and 11.1% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our income tax provision in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to an increase in pretax book income, of which a large amount was due to the gain on divestiture of C&amp;R business, as well as a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. The decrease in our income tax provision in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately $141.5 million of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company generates substantial cash flow in the U.S. and does not have a current need for the cash to be returned to the U.S. from the foreign entities. In the event these earnings are later remitted to the U.S., any estimated withholding tax and state income tax due upon remittance of those earnings is expected to be immaterial to the income tax provision. 40 Operating Income The following tables set forth certain summary information on a segment basis related to our operating income for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Scores Software The fiscal 2021 over 2020 increase in operating income of $209.5 million was primarily attributable to a $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and business divestiture during fiscal 2021, a $59.5 million decrease in segment operating expenses, a $37.1 million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges, a $22.0 million increase in segment revenues and a $7.8 million decrease in corporate expenses, partially offset by an $18.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense. At the segment level, the $89.3 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $106.4 million increase in our Scores segment operating income and a $7.8 million decrease in corporate expenses, partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in our Software segment operating income. 41 The $106.4 million increase in our Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $125.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $19.2 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores was 86%, consistent with fiscal 2020. The $24.9 million decrease in our Software segment operating income was attributable to a $103.6 million decrease in segment revenue, partially offset by a $78.7 million decrease in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Software was 16%, materially consistent with fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase in operating income of $42.4 million was attributable to a $134.5 million increase in segment revenues and a $1.1 million decrease in amortization expense, partially offset by a $45.0 million increase in restructuring and impairment charges, a $37.5 million increase in segment operating expenses, and a $10.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense. At the segment level, the $97.0 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $93.0 million increase in our Scores segment operating income and a $4.0 million increase in our Software segment operating income. The $93.0 million increase in our Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $107.4 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores was 86%, consistent with fiscal 2019. The $4.0 million increase in our Software segment operating income was attributable to a $27.1 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $23.1 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Software was 17%, consistent with fiscal 2019. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Outlook As of September 30, 2021, we had $195.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, which included $158.8 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash position could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balances, as well as available borrowings from our $600 million revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Under our current financing arrangements, we have no significant debt obligations maturing over the next twelve months. Our undistributed earnings outside the U.S. are deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not foresee a need to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue for state income or foreign withholding taxes on the distributed foreign earnings, which we expect to be immaterial. In the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. We may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. In the event additional needs for cash arise, or if we refinance our existing debt, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited. 42 Summary of Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $423.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $364.9 million in fiscal 2020. The $58.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $155.7 million increase in net income and a $28.6 million increase that resulted from timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business, partially offset by a $125.4 million decrease in non-cash items, including a $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and a business divestiture in fiscal 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $364.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $260.4 million in fiscal 2019. The $104.5 million increase was attributable to a $44.3 million increase in net income, a $46.1 million increase in non-cash items, including a $28.0 million increase in impairment loss on operating lease assets as well as a $20.0 million increase in operating lease costs, and a $14.2 million increase that resulted from timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $137.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to net cash used of $24.6 million in fiscal 2020. The $162.5 million change was primarily attributable to $147.4 million in cash proceeds from the product line asset sales and a business divestiture during fiscal 2021 and a $14.4 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $24.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $42.8 million in fiscal 2019. The $18.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $15.9 million decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and a $2.0 million decrease in net cash used for purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $523.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $289.4 million in fiscal 2020. The $234.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a $639.0 million increase in repurchases of common stock and a $350.0 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of senior notes, partially offset by a $419.0 million increase in proceeds from our revolving line of credit, a $254.0 million decrease in payments on our revolving line of credit, and an $85.0 million decrease in payments on senior notes. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $289.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $200.0 million in fiscal 2019. The $89.4 million increase was primarily due to a $338.0 million increase in payments, net of proceeds, on our revolving line of credit and a $49.9 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by a $293.0 million increase in proceeds, net of payments, from our senior notes. 43 Repurchases of Common Stock In July 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program following the completion of the previously authorized program. This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions. In March 2021, our Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program following the completion of the July 2020 program. This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $500.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions. As part of the broader share repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR Agreement”) with a financial institution in June 2021 to repurchase $200.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we paid $200.0 million to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 319,400 shares of common stock, which approximated 80% of the total number of expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. In August 2021, we settled the ASR Agreement and received 70,127 additional shares. In total, 389,527 shares were repurchased under the ASR Agreement. In August 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program following the termination of the March 2021 program. This new program is open-ended and authorizes repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $500.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions. In August 2021, we entered into a stock repurchase agreement with an institutional shareholder, pursuant to which we repurchased 515,293 shares of our common stock for $225.0 million. As of September 30, 2021, we had $173.2 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we expended $882.2 million, $235.2 million and $228.9 million, respectively, under these and previously authorized stock repurchase programs. Revolving Line of Credit On August 19, 2021, we amended our credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, increasing our borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving line of credit to $600 million, and extended its maturity to August 19, 2026. Borrowings under the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of our common stock. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) an adjusted base rate, which is the greatest of (a) the prime rate and (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.750% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.750% and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we must pay credit facility fees. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50, subject to a step up to 4.00 following certain permitted acquisitions; and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00. The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities. As of September 30, 2021, we had $518.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.212% and we were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility. On October 20, 2021, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that provides for an unsecured term loan that will mature on August 19, 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million, with an option for us to request additional incremental term loans from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The term loan is in addition to the $600 million revolving loan facility. The term loan is subject to the same pricing and covenants as the revolving line of credit. We are obligated to repay the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments equal to $3.75 million commencing March 31, 2022, subject to certain adjustments under the credit agreement. Senior Notes On May 8, 2018, we issued $400 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors (the “2018 Senior Notes”). The 2018 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 5.25% per annum and will mature on May 15, 2026. On December 6, 2019, we issued $350 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors (the “2019 Senior Notes,” and with the 2018 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2019 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 4.00% per annum and will mature on June 15, 2028. The indentures for the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2019 Senior Notes contain certain covenants typical of unsecured obligations. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value of the Senior Notes was $750.0 million and we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these obligations, and we do not believe we are at material risk of not meeting these covenants due to COVID-19. 44 Contractual Obligations The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at September 30, 2021: (1) Represents the unpaid principal amount of the Senior Notes. (2) Represents interest payments on the Senior Notes. (3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the section of the table showing payment by fiscal year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition Contracts with Customers Our revenue is primarily derived from on-premises software and SaaS subscriptions, professional services and scoring services. For contracts with customers that contain various combinations of products and services, we evaluate whether the products or services are distinct — distinct products or services will be accounted for as separate performance obligations, while non-distinct products or services are combined with others to form a single performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers. 45 Our on-premises software is primarily sold on a subscription basis, which includes a term-based license and post-contract support or maintenance, both of which generally represent distinct performance obligations and are accounted for separately. The transaction price is either a fixed fee, or a usage-based fee — sometimes subject to a guaranteed minimum. When the amount is fixed, including the guaranteed minimum in a usage-based fee, license revenue is recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits. Any usage-based fees not subject to a guaranteed minimum or earned in excess of the minimum amount are recognized when the subsequent usage occurs. We occasionally sell software arrangements consisting of on-premises perpetual licenses and maintenance. License revenue is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Our SaaS products provide customers with access to and standard support for our software on a subscription basis, delivered through our own infrastructure or third-party cloud services. The SaaS transaction contracts typically include a guaranteed minimum fee per period that allows up to a certain level of usage and a consumption-based variable amount in excess of the minimum threshold; or a consumption-based variable fee not subject to a minimum threshold. The nature of our SaaS arrangements is to provide continuous access to our hosted solutions in the cloud, i.e., a stand-ready obligation that comprises a series of distinct service periods (e.g., a series of distinct daily, monthly or annual periods of service). We estimate the total variable consideration at contract inception — subject to any constraints that may apply — and update the estimates as new information becomes available and recognize the amount ratably over the SaaS service period, unless we determine it is appropriate to allocate the variable amount to each distinct service period and recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed. Our professional services include software implementation, consulting, model development and training. They are sold either standalone, or together with other products or services and generally represent distinct performance obligations. The transaction price can be a fixed amount or a variable amount based upon the time and materials expended. Revenue on fixed-price services is recognized using an input method based on labor hours expended which we believe provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services. Revenue on services provided on a time and materials basis is recognized by applying the “right-to-invoice” practical expedient as the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer corresponds directly with the value of our performance to the customer. Our scoring services include both business-to-business and business-to-consumer offerings. Our business-to-business scoring services typically include a license that grants consumer reporting agencies the right to use our scoring solutions in exchange for a usage-based royalty. Revenue is generally recognized when the usage occurs. Business-to-consumer offerings provide consumers with access to their FICO ® Scores and credit reports, as well as other value-add services. These are provided as either a one-time or ongoing subscription service renewed monthly or annually, all with a fixed consideration. The nature of the subscription service is a stand-ready obligation to generate credit reports, provide credit monitoring, and other services for our customers, which comprises a series of distinct service periods (e.g., a series of distinct daily, monthly or annual periods of service). Revenue from one-time or monthly subscription services is recognized during the period when service is performed. Revenue from annual subscription services is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct and should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. Specifically, when implementation service is included in the original software or SaaS offerings, judgment is required to determine if the implementation service significantly modifies or customizes the software or SaaS service in such a way that the risks of providing it and the customization service are inseparable. In rare instances, contracts may include significant modification or customization of the software of SaaS service and will result in the combination of software or SaaS service and implementation service as one performance obligation. We determine the SSPs using data from our historical standalone sales, or, in instances where such information is not available (such as when we do not sell the product or service separately), we consider factors such as the stated contract prices, our overall pricing practices and objectives, go-to-market strategy, size and type of the transactions, and effects of the geographic area on pricing, among others. When the selling price of a product or service is highly variable, we may use the residual approach to determine the SSP of that product or service. Significant judgment may be required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation when it involves the consideration of many market conditions and entity-specific factors discussed above. 46 Significant judgment may be required to determine the timing of satisfaction of a performance obligation in certain professional services contracts with a fixed consideration, in which we measure progress using an input method based on labor hours expended. In order to estimate the total hours of the project, we make assumptions about labor utilization, efficiency of processes, the customer’s specification and IT environment, among others. For certain complex projects, due to the risks and uncertainties inherent with the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, actual progress may differ due to the change in estimated total hours. Adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and, accordingly, recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Capitalized Commission Costs We capitalize incremental commission fees paid as a result of obtaining customer contracts. Capitalized commission costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years — determined using a portfolio approach — based on the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate, taking into consideration both the initial and future contracts as we do not typically pay a commission on a contract renewal. The amortization costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses of our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We apply a practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Business Combinations Accounting for our acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; (ii) expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; and (iii) the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Historically, there have been no significant changes in our estimates or assumptions. To the extent a significant acquisition is made during a fiscal year, as appropriate we will expand the discussion to include specific assumptions and inputs used to determine the fair value of our acquired intangible assets. 47 In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Historically, there have been no significant changes in our valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions as it relates to business combinations. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates. Goodwill, Acquisition Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessment Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. We assess goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units on an annual basis during our fourth fiscal quarter using a July 1 measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources, which resulted in a change from three operating segments, Applications, Decision Management Software and Scores, to two operating segments, Software and Scores. As part of this reevaluation, we determined our operating segments continue to represent our reporting units. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a “step zero” approach. If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would bypass the two-step impairment test. Events and circumstances we consider in performing the “step zero” qualitative assessment include macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, internal cost factors, share price fluctuations, and the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we would perform the first step (“step one”) of the two-step impairment test and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly-traded companies. These methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly-traded companies for each reporting unit. We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment described above for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing step one of the goodwill impairment test. We performed a step one quantitative impairment test on the Software and Scores reporting units before and immediately following the change in reporting units. There was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for the reporting units and we determined goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units before or after the change for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2019 and 2020, we performed a step zero qualitative analysis for our annual assessment of goodwill impairment. After evaluating and weighing all relevant events and circumstances, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less their carrying amounts. Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2019 and 2020. 48 Our intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are assessed for potential impairment when there is evidence that events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are identified, we test for impairment using undiscounted cash flows. If such tests indicate impairment, then we measure and record the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset. Significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results used in the preparation of the projected cash flows. Should different conditions prevail, material write downs of our intangible assets or other long-lived assets could occur. We review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets at each reporting period. A reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives, if any, could result in increased annual amortization expense in future periods. We did not recognize any impairment charges on intangible assets that have finite useful lives or other long-lived assets in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. As discussed above, while we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our impairment assessments for our goodwill, acquired intangibles with finite lives and other long-lived assets. Historically, there have been no significant changes in our estimates or assumptions that would have had a material impact for our goodwill or intangible assets impairment assessment. We believe our projected operating results and cash flows would need to be significantly less favorable to have a material impact on our impairment assessment. However, based upon our historical experience with operations, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a significant change in our projections. Share-Based Compensation We measure share-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally three to four years). We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and a Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of our market share units. Our valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors. Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions. See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share-based employee benefit plans. Income Taxes We estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business, which involves significant judgment in determining our income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability using currently enacted tax rates and laws and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We then assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be realized and to the extent we believe realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income in the jurisdictions we operate; our ability to carry back tax attributes to prior years; an analysis of our deferred tax assets and the periods over which they will be realizable; and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the technical merits of the tax position indicate it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions and they are evaluated on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. 49 Contingencies and Litigation We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to products and services, technology, labor, stockholder and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters. If the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. If the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure of the matter is considered. The amount of loss accrual or disclosure, if any, is determined after analysis of each matter, and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies. Due to uncertainties related to these matters, accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time. Significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses. Revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Historically, there have been no material changes in our estimates or assumptions. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Internal-Use Software (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. We adopted ASU 2018-15 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2021 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05 and ASU 2019-11 (collectively, “Topic 326”). Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. We adopted Topic 326 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2021 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our financial statements.","In fiscal 2021, the company’s B2B scoring solutions, including the flagship FICO® Score, continued to be the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S. In January 2020 the company introduced its most predictive scores, FICO® Score 10 and 10T. The company also created the FICO® Resilience Index, a complement to FICO Scores that identifies consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO Score bands. The company continued to develop scores that use alternative data to enhance conventional credit bureau data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers.
During fiscal 2021, the company continued to advance its platform-first, cloud delivered strategy in its Software segment. This led the company to exit less strategic areas of its business in order to facilitate incremental investment in higher value, more strategic areas. As part of this process, the company divested the non-platform-based Collections and Recovery (“C&R”) business, sold all assets related to its cyber risk score operations, and sold certain assets related to its Software operations to an affiliated joint venture in China.
During fiscal 2020, the company changed its business practice of selling term software licenses with separate license and maintenance components to a single software subscription contract with license and maintenance bundled. This transition was substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of the company'sfiscal 2021. The timing of the company revenue recognition on these subscription sales changed, resulting in less revenue recognized upfront and more revenue recognized over the term of these subscriptions. This change led to a negative impact of the company’s revenue recognized from term software licenses in the company's fiscal 2021 but does not affect total revenue recognized over the life of a contract. In addition, this change does not negatively impact the company’s cash flows
•Total GAAP revenue was $1.32 billion during fiscal year 2021, a 2% increase from fiscal year 2020.

•$882.2 million was spent on share repurchases, compared with $235.2 million spent during the prior year.
The company is organized into the following two reportable segments: Software and Scores. Although the company sells solutions and services into a large number of end user product and industry markets, its reportable business segments reflect the primary method in which management organizes and evaluates internal financial information to make operating decisions and assess performance.
Scores segment revenues increased $125.6 million in fiscal 2021 from 2020 due to an increase of $64.6 million in the company's business-to-business scores revenue and $61.0 million in the company's business-to-consumer revenue. The increase in business-to-business scores revenue was primarily attributable to a higher unit price across several business-to-business offerings, as well as higher volumes. The increase in business-to-consumer revenue was attributable to an increase in both royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through consumer reporting agencies and direct sales generated from the myFICO.com website.

Revenues collectively generated by agreements with the three major consumer reporting agencies, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, accounted for 38%, 33% and 29% of the company's total revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with all three consumer reporting agencies contributing more than 10% of the company's total revenues in fiscal 2021, and Experian contributing more than 10% of the company's total revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019. Revenues from these customers included amounts recorded in the company's Software segment.
Software segment revenues decreased $103.6 million in fiscal 2021 from 2020 due to a $66.7 million decrease in on-premises and SaaS software revenue and a $36.9 million decrease in services revenue. The decrease in on-premises and SaaS software revenue was attributable to a $68.6 million decrease in revenue recognized at a point in time, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in revenue recognized over time. The decrease in point-in-time recognition was primarily attributable to the shift in the timing of revenue recognition on the company's term license subscription sales as a result of changing the company's business practice of selling term licenses with separate license and maintenance components to a single software subscription contract with license and maintenance bundled, as well as a decrease in the number and size of term license deals signed or renewed during fiscal 2021. The increase in over-time recognition was primarily attributable to an increase in SaaS subscription revenue, partially offset by the divestiture of the company's C&R business in June 2021. The decrease in services revenue was primarily due to the company's recent strategic shift to emphasize software over services, as well as the divestiture of the company's C&R business. In total, $21.7 million of the year-over-year decrease in the company's Software segment revenue was attributable to the divestiture of the company's C&R business.
Cost of revenues consists primarily of employee salaries, incentives, and benefits for personnel directly involved in delivering software products, operating SaaS infrastructure, and providing support, implementation and consulting services; allocated overhead, facilities and data center costs; software royalty fees; credit bureau data and processing services; third-party hosting fees related to the company's SaaS services; travel costs; and outside services.
The fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease of $28.7 million in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an $18.8 million decrease in personnel and labor costs, a $9.2 million decrease in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs and a $3.7 million decrease in travel costs, partially offset by an increase in direct materials costs. The decreases in personnel and labor costs, and in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs were both largely driven by the company's strategic cost initiative implemented in September 2020, in which the company reduced its workforce, consolidated office space and abandoned certain property and equipment; as well as the divestiture of the company's C&R business in June 2021. The decrease in travel costs was primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in direct materials costs was primarily attributable to increased third-party data costs related to increased Scores revenue. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 25% during fiscal 2021 from 28% during fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased sales of the company's higher-margin Scores products.
Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in December 2019, May 2018, and July 2010 (which July 2010 senior notes were paid in full at maturity in July 2020), as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit. On the company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, interest expense is netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of the company's immediate operating requirements.
The fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease in net interest expense of $2.1 million was primarily attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2021.
The fiscal 2021 over 2020 increase in operating income of $209.5 million was primarily attributable to a $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and business divestiture during fiscal 2021, a $59.5 million decrease in segment operating expenses, a $37.1 million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges, a $22.0 million increase in segment revenues and a $7.8 million decrease in corporate expenses, partially offset by an $18.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense.
At the segment level, the $89.3 million increase in segment operating income was the result of a $106.4 million increase in the company's Scores segment operating income and a $7.8 million decrease in corporate expenses, partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in the company's Software segment operating income. The $106.4 million increase in the company's Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $125.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $19.2 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores was 86%, consistent with fiscal 2020.
The $24.9 million decrease in the company's Software segment operating income was attributable to a $103.6 million decrease in segment revenue, partially offset by a $78.7 million decrease in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Software was 16%, materially consistent with fiscal 2020.
As of September 30, 2021, the company had $195.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, which included $158.8 million held by its foreign subsidiaries.
The company’s primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $423.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $364.9 million in fiscal 2020. The $58.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $155.7 million increase in net income and a $28.6 million increase that resulted from timing of receipts and payments in the company's ordinary course of business, partially offset by a $125.4 million decrease in non-cash items, including a $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and a business divestiture in fiscal 2021.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $137.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to net cash used of $24.6 million in fiscal 2020. The $162.5 million change was primarily attributable to $147.4 million in cash proceeds from the product line asset sales and a business divestiture during fiscal 2021 and a $14.4 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $523.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $289.4 million in fiscal 2020. The $234.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a $639.0 million increase in repurchases of common stock and a $350.0 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of senior notes, partially offset by a $419.0 million increase in proceeds from the company's revolving line of credit, a $254.0 million decrease in payments on the company's revolving line of credit, and an $85.0 million decrease in payments on senior notes.
On August 19, 2021, the company amended its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, increasing the company's borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving line of credit to $600 million, and extended its maturity to August 19, 2026. Borrowings under the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of the company's common stock. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) an adjusted base rate, which is the greatest of (a) the prime rate and (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.750% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.750% and is determined based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the company must pay credit facility fees. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50, subject to a step up to 4.00 following certain permitted acquisitions; and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00. The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities. As of September 30, 2021, the company had $518.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.212% and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility.
On May 8, 2018, the company issued $400 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors.  The 2018 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 5.25% per annum and will mature on May 15, 2026. On December 6, 2019, the company issued $350 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors. The 2019 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 4.00% per annum and will mature on June 15, 2028. The indentures for the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2019 Senior Notes contain certain covenants typical of unsecured obligations. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value of the Senior Notes was $750.0 million and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under these obligations.

"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “ZoomInfo Technologies Inc.” refer to ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. References in this Form 10-K to “ZoomInfo,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer (1) prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions, to ZoomInfo OpCo and its consolidated subsidiaries, and (2) after the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions, to ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. Numerical figures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them. Overview ZoomInfo is a leading go-to-market intelligence platform for sales and marketing professionals. Our cloud-based platform provides highly accurate and comprehensive information and insights on the organizations and professionals they target, enabling sellers and marketers to shorten sales cycles and increase win rates by delivering the right message, to the right person, at the right time. We are able to deliver high-quality intelligence at scale by leveraging an AI- and ML-powered engine that gathers data from millions of sources and standardizes, matches to entities, verifies, cleans, and applies the processed data to companies and people at scale to generate insights. This data engine, augmented by other data sources and our team of research analysts and data scientists, enrich our platform by creating a combination of robust systems and processes that are integrated into the workflows and CRM and sales and marketing automation systems of our customers. ZoomInfo, formerly known as DiscoverOrg, was co-founded in 2007 by our CEO, Henry Schuck. Henry founded the Company to unlock actionable business information and insights to make organizations more successful. Over time, we developed new and innovative methods for gathering and cleansing data and insights using automated processes to scale our capabilities. In February 2019, we acquired Pre-Acquisition ZI and subsequently the combined business has been re-branded as ZoomInfo. Pre-Acquisition ZI developed technologies to gather, parse, and match data at massive scale. We combined Pre-Acquisition ZI’s technology with our technology to deliver more value to customers with our combined platform that provides broader coverage and higher-quality insights. We offer access to our platform on a subscription basis and we generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of subscriptions. Our subscription fees include the use of our platform and access to customer support. Subscriptions generally range from one to three years in length with over 25% of our ACV being under multi-year agreements. We typically bill our customers at the beginning of each annual, semi-annual, or quarterly period and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period. We sell our ZoomInfo platform to both new and existing customers. Some existing customers continue to renew their subscriptions to pre-acquisition versions of the Pre-Acquisition ZI and DiscoverOrg solutions. We price our subscriptions based on the functionality, users, and records under management that are included in each product edition. Our paid product editions are Elite, Advanced, and Professional, and we have a free Community Edition. 57 Our software, insights, and data enable over 20,000 companies to sell and market more effectively and efficiently. Our customers operate in almost every industry vertical, including software, business services, manufacturing, telecommunications, financial services, retail, media and internet, transportation, education, hospitality, and real estate, and range from the largest global enterprises, to mid-market companies, down to small businesses. Many of our customers are software and business services companies. In 2020, approximately 45% and 23% of our customers, as measured by ACV, operated in the software and business services industries, respectively. In 2020, less than 4% of our customers, as measured by ACV, operated in the retail, travel, hospitality, consumer goods and services, or oil and gas industries. Our net annual retention rate was 108%, 109%, and 102% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer contributed more than 1% of revenue. We generate less than 10% of revenue from customers outside the United States. As of December 31, 2020, over 850 customers contracted for more than $100,000 in ACV for ZoomInfo services. To address our market opportunity, we have built and continue to tune our efficient go-to-market engine. We have integrated our insights and data into an automated engine with defined processes and specialized roles in order to market and sell our services. We are constantly improving the effectiveness of our engine in order to identify and close more business. We have experienced rapid organic growth, supplemented by additional growth from acquisitions. We generated revenue of $476.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $293.3 million, and income from operations of $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to income from operations of $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to our consolidated U.S GAAP financial measures, we review various non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our Adjusted Operating Income was $226.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted Operating Income Margin was 47% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 51% in 2019. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin do not include results of operations from acquired entities before their acquisitions. Recent Developments Reorganization Transactions ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. was incorporated in November 2019 with no operating assets or operations for the purposes of facilitating the IPO and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of the operating entity ZoomInfo Holdings LLC (“ZoomInfo OpCo”) (formerly known as DiscoverOrg Holdings, LLC) following the consummation of the transactions described under “Reorganization Transactions” in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Reorganization Transactions”). Following the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on June 3, 2020, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. became a holding company, with its sole material asset being a controlling equity interest in ZoomInfo Intermediate Holdings LLC (“ZoomInfo HoldCo”), which is a holding company with its sole material asset being a controlling equity interest in ZoomInfo OpCo. ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. operates and controls all of our business and affairs, and consolidates the financial results of ZoomInfo OpCo through ZoomInfo HoldCo. Accordingly, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. reports a non-controlling interest related to the OpCo Units or HoldCo Units held by our Continuing Members in our consolidated financial statements. 58 Initial Public Offering On June 8, 2020, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. completed the IPO, in which it sold 51,175,000 shares of Class A common stock (including shares issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $21.00 per share for net proceeds of $1,019.6 million, after deducting underwriters’ discounts (but excluding other offering expenses and reimbursements). ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. used all of the proceeds from the IPO to (i) purchase 48,528,783 newly issued HoldCo Units from ZoomInfo HoldCo for approximately $966.9 million (which ZoomInfo HoldCo in turn used to purchase the same number of newly issued OpCo Units from ZoomInfo OpCo); (ii) purchase 2,370,948 OpCo Units from certain Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders for approximately $47.2 million; and (iii) fund $5.5 million of merger consideration payable to certain Pre-IPO Blocker Holders in connection with the Blocker Mergers. To date, ZoomInfo OpCo has used the proceeds it received through ZoomInfo HoldCo from the IPO to (i) redeem and cancel all outstanding Series A Preferred Units of ZoomInfo OpCo for approximately $274.2 million, including accumulated but unpaid distributions and related prepayment premiums; (ii) repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under our second lien credit agreement, for approximately $380.6 million, including related prepayment premiums and accrued interest; (iii) repay $35.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Company’s first lien revolving credit facility; (iv) pay certain expenses related to the IPO; and (v) prepay $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the first lien term loans outstanding under our first lien credit agreement, including accrued interest thereon, using approximately $101.2 million of the proceeds; with the remaining proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes. OpCo Units, HoldCo Units, and Common Stock In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the limited liability company agreement of ZoomInfo OpCo was amended and restated to, among other things, reclassify its outstanding preferred and common units into a new class of units that we refer to as “OpCo Units.” A portion of the Class P Units that are held by the Continuing Class P Unitholders remain as Class P Units. Pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of ZoomInfo OpCo, the Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of such limited liability company agreement) to exchange their OpCo Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications. Pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company of ZoomInfo HoldCo, the Pre-IPO HoldCo Unitholders (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of such limited liability company agreement) to exchange their HoldCo Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications. Pursuant to ZoomInfo Technologies Inc.’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, at the option of the holder, a share of Class C common stock may be converted into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of Class C common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain affiliate transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation among the Sponsors, the Founders, and their respective affiliates as of the date of the consummation of the IPO. Each share of Class C common stock will also automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock if, on the record date for any meeting of the stockholders, the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and Class C common stock is less than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Once converted into Class A common stock, Class C common stock will not be reissued. 59 The Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders and the Pre-IPO HoldCo Unitholders that held voting units before the IPO and that continue to hold OpCo Units or HoldCo Units, as applicable, hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. The shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights but each share entitles the holder to ten votes (for so long as the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and Class C common stock represents at least 5% of the aggregate number of our outstanding shares of common stock, and thereafter, one vote per share) on all matters on which stockholders of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. are entitled to vote generally. The Pre-IPO Blocker Holders hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class C common stock. The shares of Class C common stock have the same economic rights as shares of Class A common stock, but each share entitles the holder to ten votes (for so long as the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and Class C common stock represents at least 5% of the aggregate number of our outstanding shares of common stock, and thereafter, one vote per share upon the automatic conversion of our Class C common stock into shares of Class A common stock) on all matters on which stockholders of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. are entitled to vote generally. Holders of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock vote as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law. COVID-19 In December 2019, a novel strain of Coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported, and in March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of certain businesses, and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. Such conditions are creating disruption in global supply chains, increasing rates of unemployment, and adversely impacting many industries. The outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and has triggered a period of global economic slowdown. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced headwinds and tailwinds that impacted our business. In early 2020, we experienced headwinds in some sales cycles as business leaders adapted to the impacts of the pandemic. Our sales teams adjusted to the new environment and drove improved sales and retention activity relative to prior year results. Customers in heavily impacted industries represented less than 4% of ACV, and in early 2020, we saw heightened cancellations and reductions in spend from this subset of customers relative to pre-COVID time frames. We also experienced longer sales cycles and more intense scrutiny, particularly for larger purchases and upgrades as customers and prospects re-assessed their growth trajectory in light of the changing economic environment. These headwinds dissipated during the course of the year and were partially offset by tailwinds we experienced relating to reduced spending on travel, facilities, and marketing events. By the end of 2020, demand for our platform normalized and returned to levels materially consistent with historical trends. We acknowledge the extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including: the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses to the pandemic including vaccine availability and deployment; its impact on the health and welfare of our employees and their families; its impact on our customers and our sales cycles; its impact on customer, industry, or employee events; delays in hiring and onboarding new employees; and effects on our partners and vendors, some of which are uncertain, difficult to predict, not within our control. Furthermore, because of our largely subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial condition until future periods. To address the safety and health of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the first quarter of 2020 we temporarily closed all of our offices and enabled our entire workforce to work remotely. These changes remained largely in effect throughout 2020 and could extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented to date have not affected, and are not expected to materially, affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures. See “Human Capital” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 60 Secondary Offerings On August 24, 2020, certain selling stockholders, including entities affiliated with the Sponsors, completed a secondary offering of 17,179,135 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share. The selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds of approximately $615.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount. On December 4, 2020, certain selling stockholders, including entities affiliated with the Sponsors, completed a secondary offering of 14,375,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $45.00 per share. The selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds of approximately $631.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount. Acquisitions In October 2020, the Company acquired substantially all the assets, and certain specified liabilities, of Clickagy, LLC, a leading provider of artificial intelligence-powered buyer intent data. In November 2020, the Company acquired EverString Technology, LLC, a leading artificial intelligence-powered, business-to-business (B2B) data solutions provider. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate cash consideration, inclusive of vesting cash retention payments, of approximately $71.7 million, subject to working capital and other customary adjustments, and issued 67,075 shares of unregistered Class A common stock of the Company. We funded cash payments made at closing with cash on hand. Neither acquisition had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations for the three months or year ended December 31, 2020 or the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2020. The initial accounting of the business combinations is incomplete as of the issuance date of these financial statements. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be subject to change as additional information is received, including the finalization of tax assets and liabilities. Senior Unsecured Notes Offering In February 2021, ZoomInfo Technologies LLC and ZoomInfo Finance Corp., indirect subsidiaries of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., completed an offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. We used all of the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to prepay $356.4 million aggregate principal amount of our first lien term loans outstanding under the first lien credit agreement (the “Debt Prepayment”). Following the Debt Prepayment, as of February 2, 2021, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of first lien term loans were outstanding under our first lien credit agreement. First Lien Credit Agreement Amendment In February 2021, ZoomInfo LLC entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, there will be (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments to $250.0 million under our first lien revolving credit facility, (ii) the addition of the ZoomInfo Technologies LLC as a co-borrower, (iii) the repricing of our first lien term loan facility maturing in February 2026 and first lien revolving credit facility and (iv) an extension of the maturity date of our first lien revolving credit facility to November 2025. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations. 61 Impact of the Reorganization Transactions ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. is a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our accounting predecessor, ZoomInfo OpCo, was and is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as such, only certain subsidiaries that were organized as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level historically. Accordingly, unless otherwise specified, the historical results of operations and other financial information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K only include a provision for U.S. federal income tax for income allocated to those subsidiaries that were organized as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Following the completion of the Reorganization Transactions, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. pays U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation on its share of our taxable income. ZoomInfo OpCo is the predecessor of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. for financial reporting purposes. As a result, the consolidated financial statements of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. recognize the assets and liabilities received in the reorganization at their historical carrying amounts, as reflected in the historical consolidated financial statements of ZoomInfo OpCo, the accounting predecessor. In addition, in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, we entered into the tax receivable agreements described in Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Initial Public Offering In June 2020, the company completed its IPO which significantly impacted our cash, first and second lien indebtedness, and temporary and permanent equity balances. See “—Recent Developments.” The IPO, driven by the associated first and second lien term loan repayments, significantly reduced our interest expense relative to historical results. Impact of Acquisitions We seek to grow through both internal development and the acquisition of businesses that broaden and strengthen our platform. Our recent acquisitions include NeverBounce in September 2018, Pre-Acquisition ZI in February 2019, Komiko in October 2019, Clickagy in October 2020, and EverString in November 2020. In addition, Pre-Acquisition ZI acquired Datanyze in September 2018. As discussed below under “—Results of Operations,” these acquisitions have been a significant driver of our revenue, cost of service, operating expense, and interest expense growth. Purchase accounting requires that all assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, including unearned revenue. Revenue from contracts that are impacted by the estimate of fair value of the unearned revenue upon acquisition will be recorded based on the fair value until such contract is terminated or renewed, which will differ from the receipts received by the acquired company allocated over the service period for the same reporting periods. Impact of the Zoom Information Acquisition On February 1, 2019, we acquired, through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Zebra Acquisition Corporation, 100% of the stock of Pre-Acquisition ZI for $748.0 million, net of cash acquired (the “Zoom Information Acquisition”). Pre-Acquisition ZI was a provider of company and contact information to sales and marketing professionals. The Zoom Information Acquisition qualifies as a business combination and was accounted for as such. We included the financial results of Pre-Acquisition ZI in the consolidated financial statements of ZoomInfo OpCo from the date of the Zoom Information Acquisition. Accordingly, the financial statements for the period prior to the Zoom Information Acquisition may not be comparable to those from the periods after the Zoom Information Acquisition. 62 In connection with the Zoom Information Acquisition, ZoomInfo OpCo entered into an $865.0 million first lien term loan facility, a $100.0 million first lien revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at the time of the acquisition, and a $370.0 million second lien term loan facility, and issued $207.0 million of Series A Preferred Units. In addition to funding the Zoom Information Acquisition, the additional proceeds from such facilities and Series A Preferred Units were used to repay existing debt. These debt facilities drove a significant impact to our interest expense from the date of the acquisition. We would have expected interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 to be greater than that of the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the debt being outstanding for the entire period in 2020. However, this increase was mitigated and offset by (a) a reduction in interest rates period over period, and (b) the debt repayments and prepayments referenced above and in Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized approximately $85.3 million of revenue from legacy Pre-Acquisition ZI platform contracts with acquired customers, including the renewals and upsells thereof, during the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $32.3 million was included in the unearned revenue balance recorded at the acquisition date. The fair value of acquired unearned revenue was $34.5 million, which differs from the unearned revenue recorded by Pre-Acquisition ZI immediately prior to the acquisition of $68.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the amounts received or billed by Pre-Acquisition ZI in advance of revenue recognition as of the acquisition date allocated over the service period post-acquisition was $63.9 million, which was $31.6 million greater than the amount recognized into revenue for those receipts and billings based on their fair value. We incurred approximately $2.7 million of transaction costs related to the Zoom Information Acquisition. We paid $29.7 million related to the secured credit facilities, which was accounted for as a debt discount. We also incurred $0.6 million in transaction costs associated with issuing the new Series A Preferred Units, which were issued at a 3% discount, which transaction costs were deducted from the proceeds received from the units. During 2019, we completed the integration of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including aligning reporting structures for all employees along functional lines, migrating all front-office sales and marketing activities onto a single technology stack with a single instance for key technology components, migrating back-office activities onto a single technology stack, integrating accounting, legal, and human resources activities, including financial reporting processes and benefits for employees, and developing a single platform that is being used for all sales to new customers. Additionally, as part of the integration of Pre-Acquisition ZI, we identified that certain roles and responsibilities were redundant between the two companies and terminated the employment of certain executives immediately upon the closing of the transaction. We subsequently eliminated additional positions that were no longer needed as a result of the functionally aligned reporting structure, including the Russia operations of Pre-Acquisition ZI, certain development positions in Vancouver, Washington, and certain executives from DiscoverOrg and Pre-Acquisition ZI. Expenses relating to severance paid were recorded as restructuring and transaction expenses on the statement of operations with the majority of those expenses being recognized in the three months ended March, 31, 2019, and not recurring in 2020. Expenses relating to any accelerated payments under the Cash Vesting Payment Program (see Note 4 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) were recorded as operating expense according to the functional area aligning to the employee’s salary and is included in integration and transaction-related compensation expenses when calculating non-GAAP metrics. All new customers are sold the ZoomInfo platform that we released in September 2019. We continue to support pre-existing customers on the legacy DiscoverOrg and Pre-Acquisition ZI platforms, although many pre-existing customers have agreed to upgrade to the ZoomInfo platform. The pricing constructs for subscriptions on the platforms are similar among the platforms and based on a combination of the number of seats to which the customer commits and the level of functionality and data access that the customer requires. Based on the increased level of functionality and data access, upgrading to the ZoomInfo platform will often require an increase in subscription pricing for an equivalent number of users. 63 We incurred expenses related to the integration of Pre-Acquisition ZI during 2019. Additionally, as part of the purchase of Pre-Acquisition ZI, we agreed with the former owners of Pre-Acquisition ZI to implement a Cash Vesting Payment Program to make payments to employees with respect to unvested options that were canceled at the time of the Zoom Information Acquisition. We agreed to make the payments to employees according to the remaining vesting schedule as of the acquisition date in amounts that would have been paid had the options been vested at the time of the acquisition. We reduced the originally agreed purchase price to the former owners of Pre-Acquisition ZI as a result of agreeing to make such payments. These payments are recorded as expense over the period of service on our statement of operations in the same expense line item as the salary of recipients, and we will continue to record expense for the majority of employees until 2021, and for some employees into 2022. Additionally, we engaged consulting firms and other professional services firms to help integrate our companies, including developing branding and pricing strategies for the combined platform. These expenses were recorded as sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses on our statement of operations. For analyses and non-GAAP metrics that include adjustments to operating expenses, the expenses are deemed to be integration expenses and acquisition-related compensation. Equity-Based Compensation In December 2019, HSKB modified all outstanding awards to add an alternative performance and time vesting condition and to also permit settlement through exchange into the Company’s public shares in addition to the existing cash-settlement option. This modification resulted in the revaluation of the awards in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Through the date of modification, no equity-based compensation had been recognized for these awards as the qualifying event (i.e., the IPO) was not probable. Upon completion of the IPO, the Company recognized $57.6 million of additional compensation expense attributable to service periods already elapsed on HSKB awards and the acceleration of vesting select Class P Units. The remaining unamortized fair value as of the modification date will be recognized as equity-based compensation over the remaining service period of the awards. In addition to the impact of the modified HSKB awards, new awards and modifications that took place as part of the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO will contribute to higher equity-based compensation expense in 2020 and 2021. See Note 16 - Equity-based Compensation for unamortized equity-based compensation costs related to each type of equity-based incentive award. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including the following: Continuing to Acquire New Customers We are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. The majority of revenue growth when comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was the result of new customers added over the last 24 months. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract new customers. Additionally, acquiring new customers strengthens the power of our contributory network. We will need to continue to invest in our efficient go-to-market effort to acquire new customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 11,000 customers on a combined basis, including non-overlapping customers of Pre-Acquisition ZI. As of December 31, 2019, we had over 14,000 customers. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 20,000 customers. We define a customer as a company that maintains one or more active paid subscriptions to our platform. Delivering Additional High-Value Solutions to Our Existing Customers Many of our customers purchase additional high-value solutions as they expand their use of our platform. Customers add additional services and/or upgrade their platform. We believe there is a significant opportunity for expansion with our existing customers through additional solutions. 64 Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers Many of our customers increase spending with us by adding users or integrating incremental data as they increase their use of our platform. Several of our largest customers have expanded the deployment of our platform across their organizations following their initial deployment. We believe there is a significant opportunity to add additional users and data integration within our existing customers. Our ability to expand relationships with existing customers and deliver additional high-value solutions is demonstrated by our net annual retention rate. We measure our retention rate on an annual basis and define annual net revenue retention as the total ACV generated by our customers and customers of Pre-Acquisition ZI at the end of the year divided by the ACV generated by the same group of customers at the end of the prior year. Our net annual retention rate was 108%, 109%, and 102% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also measure our success in expanding relationships with existing customers by the number of customers that contract for more than $100,000 in ACV. As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 850 customers with over $100,000 in ACV. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. These measures include, but are not limited to, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share which are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources, internal planning and forecasting, and for business strategy purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors because it eliminates certain items that affect period-over-period comparability, and it provides consistency with past financial performance and additional information about our underlying results and trends by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We view Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share as operating performance measures. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income is U.S. GAAP operating income. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP finance measure to Adjusted Operating Income Margin is U.S. GAAP operating income divided by U.S. GAAP revenue. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is U.S. GAAP Net Income, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Net Income per diluted share is U.S. GAAP net earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. This information should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items or events being adjusted. In addition, other companies may use different measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. 65 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, and Adjusted Net Income We define Adjusted Operating Income as income from operations plus (i) impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue, (ii) amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) restructuring and transaction-related expenses, and (v) integration costs and acquisition-related compensation. We exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue and amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, as well as equity-based compensation, because these are non-cash expenses or non-cash fair value adjustments and we believe that excluding these items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash-generation potential. We exclude restructuring and transaction-related expenses, as well as integration costs and acquisition-related compensation, because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted Operating Income is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance. We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted Operating Income less (i) interest expense, net (ii) other (income) expense, net, excluding TRA liability remeasurement expense (benefit) and (iii) income tax expense (benefit) including incremental tax effects of adjustments to arrive at Adjusted Operating Income and current tax benefits related to the TRA. Adjusted Net Income is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance. Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. The following table presents a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted Net Income and Income from operations to Adjusted Operating Income for the periods presented: __________________ 66 (a) Primarily represents revaluations on tax receivable agreement liability and foreign exchange remeasurement gains and losses. (b) Represents the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue relating to services billed by an acquired company, including Pre-Acquisition ZI, prior to our acquisition of that company. These adjustments represent the difference between the revenue recognized based on management’s estimate of fair value of acquired unearned revenue and the receipts billed prior to the acquisition less revenue recognized prior to the acquisition. (c) Represents costs directly associated with acquisition or disposal activities, including employee severance and termination benefits, contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit or disposal costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to professional fees for the preparation for an initial public offering and deferred acquisition cost revaluations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this expense related primarily to the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including professional fees, severance and acceleration of payments for terminated employees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this expense related primarily to Carlyle’s investment in us. (d) Represents costs directly associated with integration activities for acquisitions and acquisition-related compensation, which includes transaction bonuses and retention awards. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to cash vesting payments from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this expense related primarily to activities resulting from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including cash vesting payments and transaction bonuses, as well as expense incurred for retention awards granted upon the Company’s acquisitions of RainKing, NeverBounce, and Komiko. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this expense related primarily to retention awards granted upon our acquisition of RainKing and transaction bonuses paid upon Carlyle’s investment in us. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This expense is included in cost of service, sales and marketing expense, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense as follows: We define Adjusted Operating Income Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by the sum of revenue and the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue. Adjusted Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $226.0 million and represented an Adjusted Operating Income Margin of 47%. Adjusted Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $167.1 million and represented an Adjusted Operating Income Margin of 51%. Growth in Adjusted Operating Income in the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the year ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $58.8 million, or 35%, and was driven primarily from the growth in customers and increasing revenue from existing customers. Adjusted Operating Income Margin decreased to 47% in the year ended December 31, 2020 from 51% in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to incremental sales and marketing expenses related to signing new customers and retaining and upselling existing customers, and general and administration costs to support incremental public company related requirements. Adjusted Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $83.7 million and represented an Adjusted Operating Income Margin of 57%. Growth in Adjusted Operating Income in the year ended December 31, 2019 relative to the year ended December 31, 2018 was an increase of $83.5 million, or 100%, and was driven primarily from the growth in revenue that resulted from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI and additional customers in 2019. Adjusted Operating Income Margin decreased to 51% in the year ended December 31, 2019 from 57% in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the lower margin profile of the Pre-Acquisition ZI business and investment to drive revenue growth. 67 Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is defined as earnings before debt-related costs, including interest and loss on debt extinguishment, provision for taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Management further adjusts EBITDA to exclude certain items of a significant or unusual nature, including other (income) expense, net, impact of certain non-cash items, such as fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue and equity-based compensation, restructuring and transaction-related expenses, and integration costs and acquisition-related compensation. We exclude these items because these are non-cash expenses or non-cash fair value adjustments, which we do not consider indicative of performance and ongoing cash-generation potential or are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented: __________________ (a) Primarily represents revaluations on tax receivable agreement liability and foreign exchange remeasurement gains and losses. (b) Represents the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue relating to services billed by an acquired company, including Pre-Acquisition ZI, prior to our acquisition of that company. These adjustments represent the difference between the revenue recognized based on management’s estimate of fair value of acquired unearned revenue and the receipts billed prior to the acquisition less revenue recognized prior to the acquisition. (c) Represents costs directly associated with acquisition or disposal activities, including employee severance and termination benefits, contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit or disposal costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to professional fees for the preparation for an initial public offering and deferred acquisition cost revaluations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this expense related primarily to the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including professional fees, severance and acceleration of payments for terminated employees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this expense related primarily to Carlyle’s investment in us. 68 (d) Represents costs directly associated with integration activities for acquisitions and acquisition-related compensation, which includes transaction bonuses and retention awards. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to cash vesting payments from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this expense related primarily to activities resulting from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including cash vesting payments and transaction bonuses, as well as expense incurred for retention awards granted upon the Company’s acquisitions of RainKing, NeverBounce, and Komiko. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this expense related primarily to retention awards granted upon our acquisition of RainKing and transaction bonuses paid upon Carlyle’s investment in us. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This expense is included in cost of service, sales and marketing expense, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense as follows: Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $234.8 million, an increase of $61.6 million, or 36%, relative to the year ended December 31, 2019. This growth was driven primarily from the growth in revenue that resulted from additional customers in 2020 and 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $173.2 million, an increase of $86.9 million, or 101%, relative to the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was driven primarily from the growth in revenue that resulted from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI and additional customers in 2019 and 2018. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We derive 99% of our revenue from subscription services and the remainder from recurring usage-based services. Our subscription services consist of our SaaS applications. Pricing of our subscription contracts are generally based on the functionality provided, the number of users that access our applications, the amount of data that the customer integrates into their systems, and add-on functionality that is provided. Our subscription contracts typically have a term ranging from one to three years and are non-cancellable. We typically bill for services in advance either annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and we typically require payment at the beginning of each annual, semi-annual or quarterly period. Subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term starting with when our service is made available to the customer. Email verification service revenue is recognized in the period services are utilized by our customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. We record a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings to date for that contract. Unearned revenue results from cash received or amounts billed to customers in advance of revenue recognized upon the satisfaction of performance obligations. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including purchase accounting adjustments, seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size, and new business timing within the period. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancellable subscription agreements. Cost of Service Cost of Service, excluding amortization of acquired technology. Cost of service, excluding amortization of acquired technology includes direct expenses related to the support and operations of our SaaS services and related to our research teams, including salaries, benefits, equity-based compensation, and related expenses, such as employer taxes, allocated overhead for facilities, IT, third-party hosting fees, third-party data costs, and amortization of internally developed capitalized software. 69 We anticipate that we will continue to invest in costs of service and that costs of service as a percentage of revenue will stay consistent or modestly decrease as we realize operating leverage in the business. Amortization of acquired technology. Amortization of acquired technology includes amortization expense for technology acquired in business combinations. We anticipate that amortization of acquired technology will only increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit is revenue less cost of service, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including leveraging economies of scale, the costs associated with third-party hosting services and third-party data, the level of amortization of acquired technology, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and research organizations. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, restructuring and transaction expenses, and amortization of acquired intangibles. The most significant component of our operating expenses is personnel costs, which consists of salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits. Operating expenses also include overhead costs for facilities, technology, professional fees, depreciation and amortization expense, and marketing. Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our sales and marketing teams, as well as overhead costs, technology, and marketing programs. Sales commissions and related payroll taxes directly related to contract acquisition are capitalized and recognized as expenses over the estimated period of benefit. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing capacity to enable future growth, but that sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue will decrease as equity-based compensation expense related to the modification of HSKB awards and triggered by the IPO become a less significant component of overall sales and marketing expense. We anticipate that sales and marketing expense excluding equity-based compensation will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of our growing investments in sales and marketing capacity excluding equity-based compensation, the recognition of revenue, and the amortization of contract acquisition costs. Research and development. Research and development expenses support our efforts to enhance our existing platform and develop new software products. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our engineering and product management teams, as well as overhead costs. Research and development expenses do not reflect amortization of internally developed capitalized software. We believe that our core technologies and ongoing innovation represent a significant competitive advantage for us, and we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we invest in research and development resources to further strengthen and enhance our solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development in order to develop new features and functionality to drive incremental customer value in the future and that research and development expense as a percentage of revenue will modestly increase in the long term. 70 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other employee related benefits for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT, and business operations and administrative teams, as well as overhead costs. Additionally, we incur expenses for professional fees including legal services, accounting, and other consulting services, including those associated with operating as a public company. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to stay consistent or modestly decrease from 2020, as we realize operating leverage in the business. Amortization of other acquired intangibles . Amortization of acquired intangibles primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships, trade names, and brand portfolios. We anticipate that amortization of other acquired intangibles will only increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. Restructuring and transaction expenses. Restructuring and transaction expenses primarily consist of various restructuring and acquisition activities we have undertaken to achieve strategic or financial objectives. Restructuring and acquisition activities include, but are not limited to, consolidation of offices and responsibilities, office relocation, administrative cost structure realignment, and acquisition-related professional services fees. We anticipate that restructuring and transaction expenses will be correlated with future acquisition activity or strategic restructuring activities, which could be greater than or less than our historic levels. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense represents the interest payable on our debt obligations and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, less interest income. We anticipate that our interest expense will be substantially lower after having repaid a portion of our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from the IPO. Interest expense could increase in the future based on changes in variable interest rates or the issuance of additional debt. Loss on Debt Extinguishment Loss on debt extinguishment consists of prepayment penalties and impairment of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of debt. We anticipate that losses related to debt extinguishment will only occur if we extinguish indebtedness before the contractual repayment dates. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net consists primarily of the revaluation of tax receivable agreement liabilities and foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. We anticipate that the magnitude of other income and expenses may increase as tax receivable agreement liabilities increase, or we expand operations internationally and add complexity to our operations. 71 Benefit (expense) from Income Taxes ZoomInfo OpCo is currently treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. Benefit (expense) from income taxes, Deferred tax assets, Deferred tax liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid by our corporate subsidiaries and, to the extent paid directly by our limited liability companies and partnerships that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes, our partnerships. Our corporate subsidiaries, RKSI Acquisition Corporation and Zebra Acquisition Corporation, are subject to income taxes in the United States and hold noncontrolling interests in our subsidiary, ZoomInfo Technologies LLC. ZoomInfo Technologies LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. Any taxable income or loss generated by ZoomInfo Technologies LLC is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its partners, including ZoomInfo LLC, RKSI Acquisition Corporation, and Zebra Acquisition Corporation. However, because RKSI Acquisition Corporation and Zebra Acquisition Corporation are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions, income allocated to such corporate subsidiaries for tax purposes reduces the taxable income allocated to and distributions made to ZoomInfo OpCo. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. After consummation of the Reorganization Transactions, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. became subject to U.S. federal income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any U.S. taxable income of ZoomInfo OpCo, and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes will be recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations for federal income taxes. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, as well as payments under the tax receivable agreements, which we expect to be significant. The limited liability company agreement of ZoomInfo OpCo, provides that certain distributions to cover the taxes of the ZoomInfo Tax Group and ZoomInfo Technologies Inc.’s obligations under the tax receivable agreements will be made. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. However, our ability to make such distributions may be limited due to, among other things, restrictive covenants in our secured credit facilities. In addition, because RKSI Acquisition Corporation and Zebra Acquisition Corporation will continue to be subject to income taxes in the United States, income allocated to such corporate subsidiaries for tax purposes will reduce the distributions made to ZoomInfo OpCo, thereby reducing our allocable share of U.S. taxable income of ZoomInfo OpCo. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 72 Results of Operations The following table presents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018: __________________ (1) Includes equity-based compensation expense as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 and Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenue . Revenue was $476.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $182.9 million, or 62%, as compared to $293.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers over the past 18 months and net expansion with existing customers, and, to a lesser extent, due to the recognition of revenue for renewed contracts at the contracted value, as opposed to the fair value ascribed to acquired contracts under purchase accounting during the prior year period or recognized by Pre-Acquisition ZI before the acquisition on February 1, 2019. 73 Cost of Service. Cost of service was $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.8 million, or 57%, as compared to $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expense related to grants previously made by HSKB, modified in December 2019, and triggered by the IPO. Additional expenses related to additional headcount and hosting expense to support new and growing customers also contributed to the increase. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses were $331.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $143.0 million, or 76%, as compared to $188.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expense related to grants previously made by HSKB, modified in December 2019, and triggered by the IPO. Excluding stock-based compensation expenses, operating expenses were $237.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $70.0 million, or 42%, as compared to $167.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in sales and marketing expense (excluding an increase in stock-based compensation of $51.3 million) of $43.4 million, or 55%, to $122.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to additional headcount and related salaries and benefits expenses added to drive continued incremental sales, as well as additional commission expense and amortization of deferred commissions related to obtaining contracts with customers; • an increase in research and development expense (excluding an increase in stock-based compensation of $8.9 million) of $12.5 million, or 49%, to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to additional engineering and product management resources added to support continued innovation of our services; • an increase in general and administrative expense (excluding an increase in stock-based compensation of $12.8 million) of $14.8 million, or 49%, to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to additional headcount and related salaries and benefits expenses to support the larger organization and additional corporate expenses related to operating as a public company, which were partially offset by a decrease in integration-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2019, which did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2020; • an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles expense of $1.1 million, or 6%, to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Zoom Information Acquisition during the full period for the current year; and • restructuring and transaction-related expense of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, that were primarily related to the IPO. This represented a decrease of $1.8 million, or 12%, as compared to expense of $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, that were related to the Zoom Information Acquisition. Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net was $69.3 million for the year December 31, 2020, a decrease of $33.2 million, or 32%, as compared to $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to interest savings resulting from the repayment of our second lien term loans in full and $100.0 million of first lien term loans, offset by nonrecurring interest expense recognized upon partial dedesignation of cash flow hedges resulting from reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Loss on Debt Extinguishment . Loss on debt extinguishment was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to penalties and derecognition of deferred and unamortized debt issuance costs resulting from the repayment of the second lien term loans and $100.0 million first lien term loan principal repayment after the IPO. This represented a decrease of $3.2 million, or 18%, as compared to expense of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to costs incurred with respect to prior debt instruments that were repaid in conjunction with the Zoom Information Acquisition in February 2019. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $(15.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $15.4 million, as compared to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the recognition of a TRA remeasurement gain of $15.7 million. 74 Benefit (expense) from Income Taxes. Income tax benefit (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(4.7) million (a (14.8)% effective tax rate) compared to $6.5 million (a 7.7% effective tax rate) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a GAAP loss driven by non-deductible stock-based compensation expense resulting in positive tax expense despite the GAAP loss. Furthermore, the reorganization transactions resulted in a higher proportion of GAAP earnings being allocated to tax paying entities. Year Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenue . Revenue was $293.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $149.1 million, or 103%, as compared to $144.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to new customers acquired in the acquisitions of Pre-Acquisition ZI, NeverBounce, and Komiko, as well as the organic addition of new customers and net expansion with existing customers. Excluding the impact of the legacy platform contracts with customers acquired in the purchases of Pre-Acquisition ZI, NeverBounce, and Komiko, and the renewals and upsells thereof, revenue increased by $60.5 million. The increase in revenue, excluding the impact of customers acquired, was primarily driven by sales to new customers and, to a lesser extent, by the addition of additional subscriptions to existing customers, offset by cancellations and subscription reductions upon renewal. As of December 31, 2019, we had over 14,000 customers, an increase of about 3,000 customers, or 25%, as compared to over 11,000 customers on a combined basis, including non-overlapping customers of Pre-Acquisition ZI, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, over 580 of our customers spent more than $100,000 in ACV, an increase of approximately 200 customers, or 53%, as compared to over 380 customers of ZoomInfo and Pre-Acquisition ZI on a combined basis who spent more than $100,000 in ACV, as of December 31, 2018. On a pro forma basis, the combined revenue of ZoomInfo OpCo and Pre-Acquisition ZI would have been $334.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $128.4 million, or 62%, as compared to $205.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, calculated as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2018. Cost of Service. Cost of service was $68.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $30.8 million, or 81%, as compared to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to additional amortization of acquired technology that arose from the Zoom Information Acquisition and additional headcount and hosting expense to support acquired and new customers. On a pro forma basis, the combined cost of services of ZoomInfo OpCo and Pre-Acquisition ZI would have been $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.9 million, or 16%, as compared to $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, calculated as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2018. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses were $188.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $108.7 million, or 136%, as compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in sales and marketing expense of $47.8 million, or 113%, to $90.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to additional sales and marketing resources added through the Zoom Information Acquisition and additional hiring to drive continued incremental sales; • an increase in research and development expense of $24.0 million, or 392%, to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to additional engineering and product management resources added through the Zoom Information Acquisition; • an increase in general and administrative expense of $14.4 million, or 69%, to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to additional resources added through the Zoom Information Acquisition and additional hiring to support the larger organization; • an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles expense of $10.6 million, or 153%, to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to additional amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Zoom Information Acquisition; and 75 • an increase in restructuring and transaction-related expense of $12.0 million, or 334%, to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to expenses incurred in completing the Zoom Information acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI and restructuring activities undertaken as part of and after the Zoom Information Acquisition to rationalize certain research, engineering, and general and administrative activities, offset by restructuring and transaction-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the investment in us by Carlyle and the NeverBounce acquisition that did not recur. Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net was $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $44.3 million, or 76%, as compared to $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to additional debt that we incurred to fund the Zoom Information Acquisition, partially offset by decreasing LIBOR rates. Loss on Debt Extinguishment . Loss on debt extinguishment was $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to costs incurred with respect to prior debt instruments that were repaid in conjunction with the Zoom Information Acquisition in February 2019. There was no loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.1 million, or 67%, as compared to $(0.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Benefit from Income Taxes. Income tax benefit (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.5 million (a 7.7% effective tax rate) compared to $2.9 million (a 9.1% effective tax rate) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the impact of state taxes. The pro forma results shown above with respect to our revenue and cost of service include amortization of fair value adjustments to acquired intangible assets and fair value adjustments to unearned revenue as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2018. Management believes presenting such pro forma results is useful to investors because it demonstrates the significant impact on revenue trends resulting from the Zoom Information Acquisition during the periods presented, and the related fair value adjustments required under purchase accounting that impact year-over-year comparisons. The pro forma results shown above are provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2018, nor is it indicative of our future results. 76 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we had $269.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $30.6 million of short-term investments, $1.2 million of restricted cash, and $100.0 million available under our first lien revolving credit facility. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement which increased the aggregate commitments to $250.0 million under our first lien revolving credit facility. We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and financed various acquisitions through cash generated from operations supplemented with debt offerings. We believe that our cash flows from operations and existing available cash and cash equivalents, together with our other available external financing sources, will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We are currently in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreements governing our secured credit facilities and we expect to remain in compliance with our covenants. We generally invoice our subscription customers annually, semi-annually, or quarterly in advance of our subscription services. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as unearned revenue. Unearned revenue consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of December 31, 2020, we had unearned revenue of $222.7 million, of which $221.3 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. After the consummation of the Restructuring Transactions, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. became a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of HoldCo Units, and ZoomInfo HoldCo became a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of OpCo Units. ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. The limited liability company agreement of ZoomInfo OpCo provides that certain distributions to cover the taxes of the ZoomInfo Tax Group and ZoomInfo Technologies Inc.’s obligations under the tax receivable agreements will be made. The manager of ZoomInfo HoldCo has broad discretion to make distributions out of ZoomInfo HoldCo. In the event ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. declares any cash dividend, we expect that the manager of ZoomInfo HoldCo would cause ZoomInfo HoldCo to cause ZoomInfo OpCo to make distributions to ZoomInfo HoldCo, which in turn will make distributions to ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., in an amount sufficient to cover such cash dividends declared by us. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of ZoomInfo OpCo and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. In addition, the terms of our financing arrangements, including the secured credit facilities, contain covenants that may restrict ZoomInfo OpCo and its subsidiaries from paying such distributions, subject to certain exceptions. Further, ZoomInfo HoldCo and ZoomInfo OpCo are generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of ZoomInfo HoldCo or ZoomInfo OpCo (with certain exceptions), as applicable, exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of ZoomInfo OpCo are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to ZoomInfo OpCo. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution. See “Risk Factors.” 77 Historical Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: Cash Flows from (used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations was $169.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a net loss of $36.4 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $201.5 million and the change in our operating assets net of operating liabilities of $4.5 million. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $50.8 million, equity-based compensation of $121.6 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $14.9 million, and amortization of deferred commission costs of $25.1 million, partially offset by tax receivable agreement remeasurement of $15.7 million. The change in operating assets net of operating liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in unearned revenue of $60.1 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $21.9 million, largely offset by an increase in deferred costs and other assets of $40.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $32.9 million. Net cash provided by operations was $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a net loss of $78.0 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $93.8 million and a change of $28.6 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $48.7 million, equity-based compensation of $25.1 million, and loss on debt extinguishment of $9.4 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in unearned revenue of $71.9 million, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $18.2 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of $34.5 million and deferred costs and other assets of $27.8 million. Net cash provided by operations was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of a net loss of $28.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $67.3 million and a change of $5.1 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of $32.7 million in equity-based compensation, $17.3 million in depreciation and amortization, and $16.4 million in paid-in-kind accrued interest. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in unearned revenue of $15.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $8.9 million and in deferred costs and other assets of $3.3 million. Restructuring and transaction-related cash costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to cash IPO costs and are not expected to recur. However, we may continue to make future acquisitions as part of our business strategy which may require the use of capital resources and drive additional future restructuring and transaction-related cash expenditures as well as integration and acquisition-related compensation cash costs. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we incurred the following cash expenditures: __________________ 78 (a) Represents cash payments directly associated with acquisition or disposal activities, including employee severance and termination benefits, contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit or disposal costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these payments related primarily to the IPO, including professional fees, severance and acceleration of payments for terminated employees, and deferred consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these payments related primarily to the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including professional fees, severance and acceleration of payments for terminated employees, and deferred consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these payments related primarily to Carlyle’s investment in us. (b) Represents cash payments directly associated with integration activities for acquisitions and acquisition-related compensation, which includes transaction bonuses and retention awards. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these payments related primarily to cash vesting payments from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these payments related primarily to activities resulting from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI, including consulting and professional services costs, cash vesting payments (see Note 4 – Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and transaction bonuses and other compensation, as well as payments of retention awards granted upon the Company’s acquisitions of RainKing and NeverBounce. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these payments related primarily to retention awards granted upon our acquisition of RainKing and transaction bonuses paid upon Carlyle’s investment in us. Future demands on our capital resources associated with our debt facilities may also be impacted by changes in reference interest rates and the potential that we incur additional debt in order to fund additional acquisitions or for other corporate purposes. Future demands on our capital resources associated with transaction expenses and restructuring activities and integration costs and transaction-related compensation will be dependent on the frequency and magnitude of future acquisitions and restructuring and integration activities that we pursue. As part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses from time to time; however, we cannot predict the magnitude or frequency of such acquisitions or investments. Cash Flows from (used in) Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $113.3 million, consisting of cash paid for acquisitions of $65.9 million, purchases of short-term investments of $30.6 million, and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $16.8 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $736.7 million, primarily as a result of cash paid for acquisitions of $723.1 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $13.6 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.1 million, primarily as a result of cash payments for the acquisition of NeverBounce of $8.5 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $4.6 million. As we continue to grow and invest in our business, we expect to continue to invest in property and equipment and opportunistically pursue acquisitions. Cash Flows from (used in) Financing Activities Cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $172.2 million, primarily consisting of the IPO proceeds, net of the underwriters discount, of $1,023.7 million, proceeds from debt of $35.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of Series A Preferred Units of $274.2 million, repayment of debt of $510.9 million, purchase of OpCo Units from Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders for $47.2 million, payments of deferred consideration of $24.7 million, payment of IPO issuance costs of $7.2 million, and tax distributions to equity partners of $9.9 million. Cash provided from financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 was $725.8 million, primarily as a result of the issuance of new debt of $1,220.8 million and the Series A Preferred Unit issuance of $200.2 million, partially offset by payments on long-term debt of $649.8 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $16.7 million, and tax distributions to equity partners of $16.5 million. Cash used in financing activities for year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.9 million, primarily as a result of distributions to equity partners of $93.4 million, partially offset by the issuance of new debt of $67.3 million. Refer to Note 8 - Financing Arrangements of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to each of our borrowings. 79 Debt Obligations As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate remaining balance of $756.4 million of first lien term loans is due, in its entirety, at the contractual maturity date of February 1, 2026, which represents the only existing required future debt principal repayment obligations that will require future uses of the Company’s cash. The first lien debt has a variable interest rate whereby the Company can elect to use a Base Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable rate. The applicable margin is 2.75% to 3.00% for Base Rate loans or 3.75% or 4.00% for LIBOR Based Loans, depending on the Company’s leverage. On June 17, 2020, the Company used approximately $101.2 million to prepay $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the first lien term loans outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement, including accrued interest thereon of $1.2 million. The repayment was funded with a portion of the net proceeds received from the initial public offering of the Company’s Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $756.4 million aggregate principal amount of term loans were outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement. The interest related portion of the repayment was recorded within Interest expense, net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations, and represented use of cash from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The quarterly repayment requirement on first lien borrowings has been satisfied for the remainder of the term after the $100.0 million principal payment. The effective interest rate on the first lien debt was 4.3% and 7.5% as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio is defined in our first lien credit agreement, and the EBITDA used for that ratio (“Credit Agreement EBITDA”) differs from Adjusted EBITDA due to certain defined add-backs, including pro forma cost savings from synergies and cash generated from changes in unearned revenue; see table below for reconciliation. Credit Agreement EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 was $291.5 million. Our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio as of December 31, 2020 was 1.9x. __________________ (a) Primarily represents revaluations on tax receivable agreement liability and foreign exchange remeasurement gains and losses. (b) Represents the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue relating to services billed by an acquired company prior to our acquisition of that company. These adjustments represent the difference between the revenue recognized based on management’s estimate of fair value of acquired unearned revenue and the receipts billed prior to the acquisition less revenue recognized prior to the acquisition. 80 (c) Represents costs directly associated with acquisition or disposal activities, including employee severance and termination benefits, contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit or disposal costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to professional fees for the preparation for an initial public offering and deferred acquisition cost revaluations. (d) Represents costs directly associated with integration activities for acquisitions and acquisition-related compensation, which includes transaction bonuses and retention awards. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this expense related primarily to cash vesting payments from the acquisition of Pre-Acquisition ZI. This expense is included in cost of service, sales and marketing expense, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense as follows: In addition, our credit agreement governing our first lien term loan contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. These restrictive covenants include, among others, limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt, make acquisitions, investments, loans, and advances, or sell or otherwise dispose of assets. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt. The Company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the credit agreements governing our first lien term loan limit, but do not prohibit, the Company from incurring additional indebtedness, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions will also not prevent the Company from incurring obligations that do not constitute “Indebtedness” as defined in the agreements governing our indebtedness. In February 2021, ZoomInfo Technologies LLC and ZoomInfo Finance Corp., indirect subsidiaries of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., completed an offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. We used all of the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to consummate the Debt Prepayment.. Following the Debt Prepayment, as of February 2, 2021, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of first lien term loans were outstanding under our first lien credit agreement. In February 2021, ZoomInfo LLC entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, there will be (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments to $250.0 million under our first lien revolving credit facility, (ii) the addition of the ZoomInfo Technologies LLC as a co-borrower, (iii) the repricing of our first lien term loan facility and first lien revolving credit facility and (iv) an extension of the maturity date of our first lien revolving credit facility to November 2025. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures increased by $3.2 million, or 24%, to $16.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflects increased capital expenditures to support the larger company and greater capitalization of internal development costs. Capital expenditures increased by $9.0 million, or 196%, to $13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase reflects increased capital expenditures to support the larger company and greater capitalization of internal development costs. 81 Tax Receivable Agreements We have entered into two tax receivable agreements. We entered into (i) the Exchange Tax Receivable Agreement with certain of our Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders and (ii) the Reorganization Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Blocker Holders. These tax receivable agreements provide for the payment by members of the ZoomInfo Tax Group to such Pre-IPO Owners and certain Pre-IPO HoldCo Unitholders of 85% of the benefits, if any, that the ZoomInfo Tax Group is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of certain tax attributes and benefits covered by the tax receivable agreements. The Exchange Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by members of the ZoomInfo Tax Group to certain Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders and certain Pre-IPO HoldCo Unitholders of 85% of the benefits, if any, that the ZoomInfo Tax Group is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of (i) the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the IPO and (ii) increases in the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that will increase the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the ZoomInfo Tax Group as a result of sales or exchanges of OpCo Units for shares of Class A common stock after the IPO, and certain other tax benefits, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Exchange Tax Receivable Agreement. The Reorganization Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. to Pre-IPO Blocker Holders and certain Pre-IPO HoldCo Unitholders of 85% of the benefits, if any, that the ZoomInfo Tax Group is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies (including the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the Reorganization Transactions), and certain other tax benefits, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Reorganization Tax Receivable Agreement. In each case, these increases in existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s depreciation and amortization deductions and, therefore, may reduce the amount of tax that the ZoomInfo Tax Group would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge. The ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the IPO and the increase in the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustments upon exchanges of OpCo Units for shares of Class A common stock may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. The payment obligations under the tax receivable agreements are an obligation of members of the ZoomInfo Tax group, but not of ZoomInfo OpCo. The ZoomInfo Tax Group expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of realized cash tax benefits. For purposes of the tax receivable agreements, the realized cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the ZoomInfo Tax Group (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that the ZoomInfo Tax Group would have been required to pay had there been no existing tax basis, no anticipated tax basis adjustments of the assets of the ZoomInfo Tax Group as a result of exchanges and no utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies (including the Blocker Companies’ allocable share of existing tax basis), and had ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. not entered into the tax receivable agreements. The term of each tax receivable agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless (i) ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. exercises its right to terminate one or both tax receivable agreements for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement, (ii) ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. breaches any of its material obligations under one or both tax receivable agreements in which case all obligations (including any additional interest due relating to any deferred payments) generally will be accelerated and due as if ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. had exercised its right to terminate the tax receivable agreements, or (iii) there is a change of control of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., in which case the Pre-IPO Owners may elect to receive an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement determined as described above in clause (i). Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreements is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The amount of existing tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustments, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount of tax attributes, and the amount and timing of our income. 82 We expect that as a result of the size of the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the IPO, the increase in the ZoomInfo Tax Group’s allocable share of existing tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustment of the tangible and intangible assets of the ZoomInfo Tax Group upon the exchange of OpCo Units for shares of Class A common stock and our possible utilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. may make under the tax receivable agreements will be substantial. We estimate the amount of existing tax basis with respect to which our Pre-IPO Owners will be entitled to receive payments under the tax receivable agreements (assuming all Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders exchange their outstanding OpCo Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock on December 31, 2020) is approximately $295.2 million (assuming a price of $48.23 per share of Class A common stock, which is the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq on December 31, 2020). The payments under the tax receivable agreements are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the exchanging holders of OpCo Units. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the years in which these obligations are due: __________________ (1) Includes future principal payments on long-term indebtedness through the scheduled maturity dates thereof. Indebtedness is discussed in Note 8 - Financing Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest incurred on amounts we borrow is based on relative borrowing levels, fluctuations in the variable interest rates, and the spread we pay over those interest rates. As such, we are unable to quantify our future obligations relating to interest and therefore no amounts have been included in the above table. (2) Represents future payments on existing operating leases through the scheduled expiration dates thereof. This amount excludes lease agreements executed after December 31, 2020. (3) Includes deferred consideration related to the Zoom Information Acquisition and contingent consideration related to the Komiko acquisitions at non-discounted, currently estimated payout amounts. Acquisitions and related deferred or contingent consideration are discussed in Note 4 - Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Estimated contingent consideration is subject to change depending on results of factors each is based on. (4) Primarily relates to third-party cloud hosting and software as a service arrangements. The amounts included in the table above represent agreements that are enforceable and legally binding; any obligations under contracts that we can cancel without significant penalty are not included here. The ultimate timing of these liabilities cannot be determined; therefore, we have excluded these amounts from the contractual obligations table above. Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business are not included in the table above as they represent authorizations to purchase the items rather than binding agreements. However, if such claims arise in the future, they could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreements that we entered into may be significant and are not reflected in the contractual obligations tables set forth above, as we are currently unable to estimate the amounts and timing of the payments that may be due thereunder. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, there were “no off-balance sheet arrangements,” as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 83 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Our critical accounting policies are those that we believe have the most significant impact to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP with no need for the application of judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we believe the following topics reflect our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue primarily from subscription services. Our subscription services consist of our SaaS applications and related access to our databases. Subscription contracts are generally based on the number of users that access our applications, the level of functionality that they can access, and the amount of data that a customer integrates with their systems. Our subscriptions contracts typically have a term of one to three years and are non-cancellable. We typically bill for services annually, semi-annually or quarterly in advance of delivery. We account for revenue contracts with customers using the following steps: (i) identification of contracts with customers, (ii) identification of distinct performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determination of contract transaction price, (iv) allocation of contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) determination of revenue recognition based on the timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation(s). We recognize revenue for subscription contracts on a ratable basis over the contract term based on the number of calendar days in each period, beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Unearned revenue results from revenue amounts billed to customers in advance or cash received from customers in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Determining the transaction price often involves judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue reported. At times, the Company may adjust billing under a contract based on the addition of services or other circumstances, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates these amounts based on historical experience and reduces revenue recognized. Equity-Based Compensation Equity instruments issued in exchange for services performed by officers, employees, and directors of the Company are accounted for using a fair-value based method, and the fair value of such equity instruments are recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Historically, the Company has issued profits interests to employees and officers with a return threshold that is set based on the fair value of the Company, as determined by the board of directors. Equity-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date of the equity-based awards that vest over set time periods. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite services period. For profits interests, fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determine the assumptions for the option-pricing model as follows: • Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date closest to the grant date for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected life of the equity grants. 84 • Expected life - The expected life represents the period of time that the equity-based awards are expected to remain outstanding, giving consideration to vesting schedules and forfeiture patterns. • Volatility - The volatility is based on the historical volatility of the stock prices for comparable companies with a look-back period consistent with the expected life. • Dividend yield - The dividend yield is assumed to be zero. Equity-based compensation that vests based on a performance event, such as a liquidity event, begins to be recognized at the date that the performance event becomes probable, and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over any remaining service period. As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07 and upon the adoption, the Company determined the fair value of outstanding non-vested, non-employee awards and will recognize expense in the same periods and in the same manner as if the Company were to pay cash to the recipient in lieu of the non-employee award. Performance vesting programs are primarily payable in cash from an upper-tier holder of Company equity units based on the appreciation of such units. These awards were modified in December 2019 to add an alternative performance and time vesting condition and to also permit settlement through exchange into the Company’s shares in addition to the existing cash-settlement option. The Company re-determined the fair value of these outstanding non-vested, non-employee awards at the time of the modification in December 2019. The modified fair value of these incentive units is based on the Company’s underlying common unit equivalent. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity interests issued, after considering any transactions that are separate for the business combination. The excess of fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and contingent liabilities. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer bases, acquired technology and acquired trade names, useful lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement during the measurement period for an acquisition, which may last up to one year from the acquisition date. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. After the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We re-evaluate these items based upon the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill, provided that the timing is within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will be recorded to earnings. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase consideration paid in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is assigned to each of the Company’s reporting units and is tested for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. The Company has one reporting unit. 85 We first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative test by determining the fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates, including the discount rate, growth rate, and future financial performance. Valuations of similarly situated public companies are also evaluated when assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Acquired technology, customer lists, trade names or brand portfolios, and other intangible assets are related to previous acquisitions. Acquired intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period over which we expect to realize economic value related to the intangible asset. The amortization periods range from two years to 15 years. Acquired intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually, or more often if and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Tax Receivable Agreements In connection with our IPO, we entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with certain non-controlling interest owners (the “TRA Holders”). The TRAs generally provide for payment by the Company to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings. We account for amounts payable under the TRA in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450, Contingencies . As such, subsequent changes to the measurement of the TRA liability are recognized in the statements of income as a component of other income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a liability of $271.0 million related to its projected obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and OpCo units exchanged. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a TRA remeasurement gain of $15.7 million. See Note 18 - Tax Receivable Agreements for further details on the TRA liability. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method, whereby tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We regularly evaluate the valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. is a corporation and is subject to U.S. federal as well as state income tax related to its ownership percentage in ZoomInfo Holdings LLC. ZoomInfo Holdings LLC is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and files a U.S. Return of Partnership Income. Consequently, the members of ZoomInfo Holdings are taxed individually on their share of earnings for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. However, ZoomInfo Holdings is subject to the Texas Margins Tax. Additionally, our operations in Israel are subject to local country income taxes. See Note 19 - Income Taxes for additional information regarding income taxes. 86 JOBS Act Accounting Election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. 87","ZoomInfo is a leading go-to-market intelligence platform for sales and marketing professionals. The company’s cloud-based platform provides highly accurate and comprehensive information and insights on the organizations and professionals they target, enabling sellers and marketers to shorten sales cycles and increase win rates by delivering the right message, to the right person, at the right time.
ZoomInfo is able to deliver high-quality intelligence at scale by leveraging an AI- and ML-powered engine that gathers data from millions of sources and standardizes, matches to entities, verifies, cleans, and applies the processed data to companies and people at scale to generate insights. This data engine, augmented by other data sources and the company’s team of research analysts and data scientists, enrich its platform by creating a combination of robust systems and processes that are integrated into the workflows and CRM and sales and marketing automation systems of our customers.
The company offers access to its platform on a subscription basis and ZooInfo generates substantially all of its revenue from sales of subscriptions. Its subscription fees include the use of the company’s platform and access to customer support. Subscriptions generally range from one to three years in length with over 25% of its ACV being under multi-year agreements.
The company’s software, insights, and data enable over 20,000 companies to sell and market more effectively and efficiently. Its customers operate in almost every industry vertical, including software, business services, manufacturing, telecommunications, financial services, retail, media and internet, transportation, education, hospitality, and real estate, and range from the largest global enterprises, to mid-market companies, down to small businesses. Many of the company’s customers are software and business services companies. In 2020, approximately 45% and 23% of the company’s customers, as measured by ACV, operated in the software and business services industries, respectively. In 2020, less than 4% of its customers, as measured by ACV, operated in the retail, travel, hospitality, consumer goods and services, or oil and gas industries. The company’s net annual retention rate was 108%, 109%, and 102% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
On June 8, 2020, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. completed the IPO, in which it sold 51,175,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share for net proceeds of $1,019.6 million. On August 24, 2020, certain selling stockholders, including entities affiliated with the Sponsors, completed a secondary offering of 17,179,135 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share. The selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds of approximately $615.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount. On December 4, 2020, certain selling stockholders, including entities affiliated with the Sponsors, completed a secondary offering of 14,375,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $45.00 per share. The selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds of approximately $631.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount.
In October 2020, the Company acquired substantially all the assets, and certain specified liabilities, of Clickagy, LLC, a leading provider of artificial intelligence-powered buyer intent data. In November 2020, the Company acquired EverString Technology, LLC, a leading artificial intelligence-powered, business-to-business (B2B) data solutions provider. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate cash consideration, inclusive of vesting cash retention payments, of approximately $71.7 million, subject to working capital and other customary adjustments, and issued 67,075 shares of unregistered Class A common stock of the Company.
In February 2021, ZoomInfo Technologies LLC and ZoomInfo Finance Corp., indirect subsidiaries of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc., completed an offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. The company used all of the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to prepay $356.4 million aggregate principal amount of its first lien term loans outstanding under the first lien credit agreement. Following the debt prepayment, as of February 2, 2021, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of first lien term loans were outstanding under the company’s first lien credit agreement.
Revenue was $476.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $182.9 million, or 62%, as compared to $293.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers over the past 18 months and net expansion with existing customers, and, to a lesser extent, due to the recognition of revenue for renewed contracts at the contracted value, as opposed to the fair value ascribed to acquired contracts under purchase accounting during the prior year period or recognized by Pre-Acquisition ZI before the acquisition on February 1, 2019.
Operating expenses were $331.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $143.0 million, or 76%, as compared to $188.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expense related to grants previously made by HSKB, modified in December 2019, and triggered by the IPO.
Interest expense, net was $69.3 million for the year December 31, 2020, a decrease of $33.2 million, or 32%, as compared to $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to interest savings resulting from the repayment of the company’s second lien term loans in full and $100.0 million of first lien term loans.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $234.8 million, an increase of $61.6 million, or 36%, relative to the year ended December 31, 2019. This growth was driven primarily from the growth in revenue that resulted from additional customers in 2020 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, the company had $269.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $30.6 million of short-term investments, $1.2 million of restricted cash, and $100.0 million available under the company’s first lien revolving credit facility. In February 2021, the company increased the aggregate commitments to $250.0 million under its first lien revolving credit facility. The company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and financed various acquisitions through cash generated from operations supplemented with debt offerings.
Net cash provided by operations was $169.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a net loss of $36.4 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $201.5 million and the change in our operating assets net of operating liabilities of $4.5 million. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $50.8 million, equity-based compensation of $121.6 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $14.9 million, and amortization of deferred commission costs of $25.1 million, partially offset by tax receivable agreement remeasurement of $15.7 million. The change in operating assets net of operating liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in unearned revenue of $60.1 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $21.9 million, largely offset by an increase in deferred costs and other assets of $40.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $32.9 million.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $113.3 million, consisting of cash paid for acquisitions of $65.9 million, purchases of short-term investments of $30.6 million, and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $16.8 million.
Cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $172.2 million, primarily consisting of the IPO proceeds, net of the underwriters discount, of $1,023.7 million, proceeds from debt of $35.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of Series A Preferred Units of $274.2 million, repayment of debt of $510.9 million, purchase of OpCo Units from Pre-IPO OpCo Unitholders for $47.2 million, payments of deferred consideration of $24.7 million, payment of IPO issuance costs of $7.2 million, and tax distributions to equity partners of $9.9 million.

See also “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of “Item 1. Business.” 43 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We have based the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies that we have used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue/collectability. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Revenue Recognition. License. Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer. Our perpetual software licenses are sold with maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Subscription. Subscription fees include Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS"") revenue for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party. The customer accesses and uses the software on an as needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software. The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually. The Company’s SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Professional Services and Other. Our professional services revenue consists of fees generated from consulting, implementation and training services, including reimbursements of out-pocket expenses in connection with our services. These services are typically optional to our customers, and are distinct from our software. Fees for our professional services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. We believe the output method of hours worked provides the best depiction of the transfer of our services since the customer is receiving the benefit from our services as the work is performed. Reimbursements received from customers for out-of-pocket expenses were recorded in revenue and totaled approximately $20,000, $1.5 million, and $1.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Maintenance and Support. Revenue is derived from maintenance and support services, under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Maintenance for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Maintenance terms typically range from one to three years. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress. Support services for subscriptions are included in the subscription fees and are recognized as a component of such fees. Indirect Channel Revenue. We record revenue from sales made through the indirect sales channels on a gross basis, because we control the goods or services and act as the principal in the transaction. In reaching this determination, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis and consider a number of factors including indicators of control such as the party having the primary responsibility to provide specified goods or services, and the party having discretion in establishing prices. Sales Taxes. We account for sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis . 44 Significant Judgments. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract. We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstanc es to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase on-premise license support contracts at the time of a on-premise license purchase. Support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the on-premise license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to on-premise license revenue. 45 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain revenue and expense items as a percentage of total revenue for the three years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the percentage increases and decreases in those items for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020: nm - not meaningful Economic Overview and Significant Trends in Our Business For fiscal 2022, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to recent periods. We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems, which could result in an improved selling environment. Although this improvement could slow or regress at any time, due in part to concerns related to the effects of the spread of the global virus and trade conflicts on global capital markets and general economic conditions, we believe that our organizational and financial structure will enable us to take advantage of any sustained economic rebound. While we do not expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause any material adverse changes on our business or financial results for fiscal 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases. Corporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software. Corporate capital spending is, in turn, a function of general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and in particular may be affected by conditions in U.S. and global credit markets. In recent years, the weakness in the overall global economy and the U.S. economy has resulted in reduced expenditures in the business software market. 46 In April 2021, the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook for the 2021 and 2022 world economic growth forecast. The update noted that, “High uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook, primarily related to the path of the pandemic. The contraction of activity in 2020 was unprecedented in living memory in its speed and synchronized nature. But it could have been a lot worse. Although difficult to pin down precisely, IMF staff estimates suggest that the contraction could have been three times as large if not for extraordinary policy support. Much remains to be done to beat back the pandemic and avoid divergence in income per capita across economies and persistent increases in inequality within countries. After an estimated contraction of –3.3 percent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth out turns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year.” As the economy improves from the COVID-19 decline, we believe that the recovery may drive some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases. If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor our supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customer’s business. While the recent difficult economic environment has had a particularly adverse impact on the weaker companies in our target markets, we believe a large percentage of our customers are seeking to make investments to strengthen their operations, and some are taking advantage of current economic conditions to gain market share. We have taken steps to best ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model, and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are supported as they navigate through this unprecedented period. Business Opportunities and Risks We currently view the following factors as the primary opportunities and risks associated with our business: • Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns . There is risk associated with our dependence on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which in turn are functions of economic trends and conditions over which we have no control. • Acquisition Opportunities . There are opportunities for selective acquisitions or investments to expand our sales distribution channels and/or broaden our product offering by providing additional solutions for our target markets. • Acquisition Risks . There are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies, including the risks that we will not achieve the financial and strategic goals that we contemplate at the time of the transaction. More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business. • Competitive Technologies . There is a risk that our competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. • Competition in General . There are risks inherent in the market for business application software and related services, which has been and continues to be intensely competitive; for example, some of our competitors may become more aggressive with their prices and/or payment terms, which may adversely affect our profit margins. For more information, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1(n) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Market Conditions by Operating Segment 47 We operate and manage our business in three segments based on software and services provided in three key product markets: (1) SCM, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the production, distribution and management of products between trading partners; (2) IT Consulting, which consists of IT staffing and consulting services; and (3) Other, which consists of (i) American Software ERP, a provider of purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, human resources, and manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses. The SCM segment includes the businesses of Logility and DMI. Our SCM segment experienced a 5% decrease in revenue during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 60% decrease in license fees, a 17% decrease in professional services and other revenue and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees. Our SCM segment experienced a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 57% increase in subscription fees, a 12% increase in professional services and other revenue and a 5% increase in license fees partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue. Our IT Consulting segment experienced an approximately 6% increase in revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 and a 10% decrease in revenue in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to fluctuations in IT staffing work at our largest customer. As companies have moved to cut costs and limit IT budgets, they have utilized more outsourcing services, which tend to be more cost effective for them. In the past, this trend has resulted in increased business for this segment. However, there is a countervailing trend to outsource IT to international markets that historically have been more price competitive than domestic sources like us. Our largest consulting customer comprised 29% of our IT Consulting revenue in fiscal 2021, 33% in fiscal 2020 and 47% in fiscal 2019. The loss of this customer would negatively and materially affect our IT Consulting business. The Other segment revenue decreased 14% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 93% decrease in license fees, a 13% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 1% decrease in maintenance revenue. The Other segment revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 70% increase in license fees and a 4% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 6% decrease in maintenance revenue. REVENUE For the year ended April 30, 2021, the 4% decrease in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 61% decrease in license revenue, a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 7% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees revenue. For the year ended April 30, 2020, the 6% increase in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 57% increase in subscription fees revenue, a 6% increase in license revenue and a 1% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue. Due to intensely competitive markets, we discount subscription and license fees from our published list price due to pricing pressure in our industry. Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, the type of platform deployment, as well as the overall size of the contract. While all these factors affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods. The change in our revenue from period to period is primarily due to the volume of products and related services sold in any period and the amounts of products or modules purchased with each sale. 48 International revenue represented approximately 15% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, 19% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020, and 20% for the year ended April 30, 2019. Our international revenue may fluctuate substantially from period to period primarily because we derive these revenue from a relatively small number of customers. Subscription Fees Revenue For the year ended April 30, 2021, subscription fee revenue increased by 31% when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in Cloud Services Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") of approximately 53% to $26.4 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was attributable to an increase in the number of contracts, contracts with a higher Cloud Services ACV, as well as an increase in the value of multi-year contracts (typically three to five years). This is evidence of our successful transition to the cloud subscription model. ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand Cloud Services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period. License Fees Revenue For the year ended April 30, 2021, license fee revenue decreased by 61% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 93% decrease in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. Our SCM segment experienced a 60% decrease in license fees primarily due to a decrease in the number of new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise this year. We anticipate that the majority of future license fee sales will be to existing on-premise customers for add-on expansion. The SCM segment constituted 99%, 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended April 30, 2020, license fee revenue increased by 6% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 70% increase in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. SCM experienced a 5% increase in license fees primarily due to a few new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise. SCM constituted 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The direct sales channel provided approximately 83% of license fee revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared to approximately 92% in fiscal 2020 and 84% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in direct license fees from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was largely due to one large license fee deal to a new customer last year compared to none this year. The increase in direct license fees from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was largely due to our indirect channel selling proportionately more SaaS than license contracts compared to our direct channel. For the year ended April 30, 2021, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 84%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 58%. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our margins after commissions on 49 direct sales were approximately 88%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 53%. For the year ended April 30, 2019, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 55%. The margins after commissions for direct sales were relatively consistent, between 84% to 88%, while the range for indirect sales had a wider spread of 53% to 58%. The indirect channel margins for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller (“VAR”) commission rates. DMI is responsible for the bulk of our indirect sales and the commission percentage varies based on whether the sale is domestic or international. Professional Services and Other Revenue The 7% decrease in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 17% decrease in our SCM segment professional services due primarily due to lower implementation project work resulting from lower subscription and license fee sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, combined with a 13% decrease in our Other segment due to lower utilization from project implementation services and services activity. This increase was partially offset by a 6% increase in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work. The 1% increase in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 12% increase from our SCM segment due primarily due to a ramp up of implementation project work resulting from increased subscription and license fee sales in recent periods, combined with a 4% increase in our Other segment due to utilization from project implementation services and services revenue. This increase was partially offset by an 10% decrease in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work. In our software segments, we have observed that there is a tendency for professional services and other revenue to lag changes in license revenue by one to three quarters, as new licenses in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenue only as we perform those services. Maintenance Revenue The 7% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 1% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition and customers converting from on-premise support to our SaaS cloud platform. The 5% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 6% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition. 50 The SCM segment’s maintenance revenue constituted 97% of total maintenance revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Typically, our maintenance revenue has had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenue, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers. GROSS MARGIN The following table provides both dollar amounts and percentage measures of gross margin: The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 decreased to 54% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in gross margin percentage for professional services and other gross margins, license fees margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by an increase in subscription fees. The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 increased to 55% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in gross margin percentage for license fees, professional services and other gross margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by a decrease in subscription fees margins. Gross Margin on Subscription Fees For the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees increased from 57% in fiscal 2020 to 59% primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue and lower capitalized software amortization expense. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees decreased from 59% in fiscal 2019 to 57% primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization expense. Gross Margin on License Fees The decrease in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower license fee revenue. The increase in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower agent commission and amortization of intangibles expense and to a lesser extent higher license fee revenue. License fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenue due to the relatively fixed cost of capitalized software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels. Gross Margin on Professional Services and Other For the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other decreased from 28% in fiscal 2020 to 27% primarily because our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue gross margin decreased from 18% in fiscal 2020 to 17% in fiscal 2021 due to a decrease in project utilization rates. Our other segment decreased from 53% in fiscal 2020 to 41% in fiscal 2021 due to a slower ramp up of project work. Our SCM segment professional services and other gross margin was 35% for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other increased from 25% in fiscal 2019 to 28% due to increased gross margins in our SCM segment which increased from 28% in fiscal 2019 to 35% in fiscal 2020 due to increased revenue and higher billing utilization. Our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue 51 gross margin decreased from 22% in fiscal 2019 to 18% in fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in project related billing. Our other segment increased from 47% in fiscal 2019 to 53% in fiscal 2020 due to improved billing utilization rates. As discussed above, our IT Consulting segment typically has lower margins when compared to the Other segments that have higher margin implementation service revenue. The IT Consulting segment was 48%, 42% and 47% of the Company’s professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our SCM segment was 50%, 56% and 50% of the Company’s professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Other segment was 2%, 2% and 3% of the Company’s professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross Margin on Maintenance Maintenance gross margin decreased to 81% in fiscal 2021 from 83% in fiscal 2020 due to lower maintenance revenue cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term. Maintenance gross margin increased to 83% in fiscal 2020 from 82% in fiscal 2019 due to cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term. EXPENSES Research and Development Gross product research and development costs include all non-capitalized and capitalized software development costs. A breakdown of the research and development costs is as follows: ______________ * Included in cost of license fees and cost of subscription fees. For the year ended April 30, 2021, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 5% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2020. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the timing of project work and an increase in agile software programming that accelerates the software releases to weeks from months. We expect capitalized software to be 52 immaterial in fiscal 2022. Amortization of capitalized software development decreased 28% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 as some projects were fully amortized. For the year ended April 30, 2020, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 3% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2019. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project work. Amortization of capitalized software development increased 27% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project releases. Sales and Marketing For the year ended April 30, 2021, the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to lower marketing spend, including a reduction in trade shows and conferences and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. Fiscal 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 for the entire year versus fiscal 2020. For the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in headcount, higher variable compensation, higher sales commissions, an increase in contractor costs and an increase in recruiting fees, which was partially offset by lower marketing spend and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. General and Administrative For the year ended April 30, 2021, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, legal fees and cost containment efforts of overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in insurance and benefit expenses. For the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher overhead costs and, to a lesser extent, higher legal, stock option and insurance costs. The total number of employees was 424 on April 30, 2021, 428 on April 30, 2020 and 424 on April 30, 2019. Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets For the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded $0.8 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.2 million is included in operating expenses and $0.6 million is included in cost of license fees. For the year ended April 30, 2020, we recorded $1.6 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.3 million is included in operating expenses and $1.3 million is included in cost of license fees. Operating Income/(Loss) ______________ * Includes certain unallocated expenses. Our SCM segment operating income decreased by 4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 5% decrease in revenue. Our SCM segment operating income increased by 23% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue. Our IT Consulting segment operating income increased 37% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 6% increase in revenue due to the type of project billing. Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 66% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in revenue and lower gross margins due to the type of project billing. 53 The increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a 14% decrease in revenue and an increase in variable compensation and benefit costs. The increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and overhead costs, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue in fiscal 2020. Other Income Other income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income net of related depreciation expenses, exchange rate gains and losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. Other income was approximately $4.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of $3.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to unrealized losses of $0.1 million for the same period last year, lower interest income of $0.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 and exchange rate gains of approximately $53,000 compared to losses of $605,000 for the same period last year. Other income was approximately $0.8 million in the year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to unrealized losses of $0.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to unrealized gains of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, lower interest income of $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2019 and higher exchange rate losses of approximately $605,000 compared to $486,000 for the same period last year. For the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Income Taxes During the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $759,000 compared to $56,000 in fiscal 2020 and $838,000 in fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income by state and available income tax credits. Our effective tax rate was 8.6%, 1%, and 11% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 is higher compared to fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in the amount of excess tax benefits from stock option deductions and a decrease in foreign tax credits. Operating Pattern We experience an irregular pattern of quarterly and annual operating results, caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter and our ability to recognize revenue in that quarter and annually in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. We expect this pattern to continue. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources and Uses of Cash We have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore we used no cash for debt service purposes. The following tables provide information about our cash flows and liquidity positions as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. You should read these tables and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 8 of this report. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: (1) a decrease in the net proceeds from sales and maturities of trading securities due to timing of sales and maturity dates, (2) unrealized 54 gains on investments due to timing of sales of investments, (3) lower depreciation and amortization expense due to several capitalized software projects and intangible assets being fully amortized and (4) a lower increase in accounts payable and other liabilities during fiscal 2021, when compared to a higher increase in fiscal 2020 due primarily to timing and the amount of sales commissions and bonuses. These factors were partially offset by: (1) a decrease in the purchases of trading securities due to timing, (2) the decrease in accounts receivable was more significant in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2021 due to timing of sales and billing, (3) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in fiscal 2021 compared to the decrease in fiscal 2020 due to timing of purchases, (4) an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the timing of cloud and maintenance revenue recognition, (5) an increase in net earnings, (6) higher stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in options granted and (7) a decrease in deferred income taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to timing. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to: a decrease in capitalized software development costs due to the timing of R&amp;D efforts and partially offset by higher purchases of equipment. The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: a decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding. The following table provides information regarding the changes in our total cash and investments position: As of April 30, 2021, we had $104.7 million in total cash and investments with no outstanding debt, and believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs during at least the next twelve months. However, at some future date we may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet our requirements. If such need arises, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. We currently do not have a bank line of credit. We can provide no assurance that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to us. If available, such financing may result in dilution to our shareholders or higher interest expense. Days Sales Outstanding (""DSO"") in accounts receivable were 85 and 78 days as of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, respectively. Our current ratio on April 30, 2021 was 2.7 to 1, compared to 2.9 to 1 on April 30, 2020. DSO can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including the percentage of total revenue that comes from software license sales (which typically have installment payment terms), seasonality, shifts in customer buying patterns, the timing of customer payments and annual SaaS and maintenance renewals, lengthened contractual payment terms in response to competitive pressures, the underlying mix of products and services, and the geographic concentration of revenue. On August 19, 2002, our Board of Directors approved a resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. These repurchases have been and will be made through open market purchases at prevailing market prices. The timing of any repurchases will depend upon market conditions, the market price of our common stock and management’s assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs. For this repurchase plan, through April 30, 2021, we have repurchased 1,053,679 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $6.2 million. Under all repurchase plans as of April 30, 2021, we have repurchased 4,588,632 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $25.6 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 55 See Item 5 of this report, under the caption “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”","American Software, Inc..

ASI operates and manages its business in three segments based on software and services provided in three key product markets: (1) Supply Chain Management (“SCM”), which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the production, distribution and management of products between trading partners; (2) IT Consulting, which consists of IT staffing and consulting services; and (3) Other, which consists of (i) American Software Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), a provider of purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, human resources, and manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses.

The company’s SCM segment experienced a 5% decrease in revenue during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 60% decrease in license fees, a 17% decrease in professional services and other revenue and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees.

ASI’s IT Consulting segment experienced an approximately 6% increase in revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to fluctuations in IT staffing work at the company’s largest customer. As companies have moved to cut costs and limit IT budgets, they have utilized more outsourcing services, which tend to be more cost effective for them. In the past, this trend has resulted in increased business for this segment. However, there is a countervailing trend to outsource IT to international markets that historically have been more price competitive than domestic sources like us. ASI’s largest consulting customer comprised 29% of its IT Consulting revenue in fiscal 2021, 33% in fiscal 2020 and 47% in fiscal 2019. The loss of this customer would negatively and materially affect ASI’s IT Consulting business.

The Other segment revenue decreased 14% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 93% decrease in license fees, a 13% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 1% decrease in maintenance revenue.

For the year ended April 30, 2021, the 4% decrease in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 61% decrease in license revenue, a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 7% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees revenue.

The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 decreased to 54% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in gross margin percentage for professional services and other gross margins, license fees margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by an increase in subscription fees.

For the year ended April 30, 2021, the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to lower marketing spend, including a reduction in trade shows and conferences and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. Fiscal 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 for the entire year versus fiscal 2020.

ASI has historically funded, and continues to fund, its operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that its operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. The company has no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore ASI used no cash for debt service purposes.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: (1) a decrease in the net proceeds from sales and maturities of trading securities due to timing of sales and maturity dates, (2) unrealized gains on investments due to timing of sales of investments, (3) lower depreciation and amortization expense due to several capitalized software projects and intangible assets being fully amortized and (4) a lower increase in accounts payable and other liabilities during fiscal 2021, when compared to a higher increase in fiscal 2020 due primarily to timing and the amount of sales commissions and bonuses.

The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to: a decrease in capitalized software development costs due to the timing of R&D efforts and partially offset by higher purchases of equipment.

The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: a decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding.

As of April 30, 2021, ASI had $104.7 million in total cash and investments with no outstanding debt, and believes that its sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs during at least the next twelve months. However, at some future date ASI may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet its requirements. If such need arises, the company may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. ASI currently does not have a bank line of credit.

"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements,”, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part II, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We were founded in 1999 and are a leader in agile software solutions that help companies turn stakeholder feedback into action. Our platform empowers users to collect, analyze, and act on feedback from customers, employees, website and app users, and market research audiences. SurveyMonkey’s products enable more than 345,000 organizations to deliver better customer experiences, increase employee retention, and unlock growth and innovation. We offer SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillars—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research. We operate as a single operating segment. Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis in order to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. Our CODM uses one measure of profitability and does not segment our business for internal reporting. Impact of COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified certain aspects of our business, including restricting employee travel, requiring employees to work from home, transitioning our employee onboarding and training processes to remote or online programs, and canceling certain events and meetings, among other modifications. We continue to actively monitor and evaluate the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and stockholders. The effects of these operational modifications are unknown and may not be realized until further reporting periods. The full impact of the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain as the businesses of our customers and partners have been, and in some cases continue to be, disrupted. We have experienced a more challenging enterprise sales environment, longer sales cycles, and an increase in attrition rates, particularly among customers in segments and industries more severely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and hospitality. In addition, some of our existing and potential customers are financially constrained in their ability to purchase our products, which we expect may negatively impact our ability to collect payments, acquire new customers, or renew subscriptions with or sell additional subscriptions to our existing customers. We expect such impacts on our revenue and costs to continue through the duration of this crisis. We expect that our business and consolidated results of operations will be impacted and that our financial condition in the future could be impacted as well. While we have not experienced significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers and partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain, and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We are continuously evaluating the nature and extent of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. Our products We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our products. Our current product portfolio is structured into three primary product pillars—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research. 45 We offer products from our Survey and Market Research pillars on a self-serve basis through our website and we offer a suite of enterprise-grade feedback software solutions from all three pillars through our direct sales force. Our business model We are continuing our rapid evolution from a self-serve online survey tool provider into an enterprise SaaS company. Through a combination of product innovation and acquisitions, we now offer SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillars—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research. Concurrently, we are building a sales force to increase new sales and cross-selling of our SaaS offerings into small, midsize, and large enterprises. Our survey platform is inherently viral, as existing users send surveys and share survey results that introduce potential new users and customers to our products. This virality, combined with the ease-of-use and price-disruptive nature of our products and the strength of the SurveyMonkey brand, has enabled us to build an efficient, online self-serve channel for selling versions our survey products. We have a broad and diverse customer base and no customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in any of the periods presented. 46 To capitalize on the virality of our platform and the scale of business use cases in our user base, we are executing against a two-part growth strategy: 1) deliver new features and product tiers to drive platform usage and increase the conversion of free users to paid subscribers in our self-serve channel; and 2) continue investing in product innovation and go-to-market initiatives to win new customers and convert existing self-serve subscribers to our three enterprise product pillars: Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research. As we execute on this strategy and sell more of our products into enterprises directly, we believe we can accelerate our revenue growth profile and increase our customer retention rates over time. We believe our existing user base represents a significant opportunity to expand our business and increase our revenue. In 2020, approximately 29 % of our total revenue was generated from customers who purchased software through our enterprise sales force, up from 21 % in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we ha d over 20 million active users, of which approximately 820 , 3 00 were paying users and of our paying users we ha d approximately 8 , 2 00 customers who purchased our software through our enterprise sales channel. As of December 31, 2020, over 90% of our trailing 12-month bookings were from organizational domain-based customers, which are customers who register with us using an email account with an organizational domain name, such as @surveymonkey.com, but excludes customers with email addresses hosted on widely used domains such as @gmail, @outlook or @yahoo. As of December 31, 2020, our dollar-based net retention rate for organizational domain-based customers was over 100%. We calculate bookings as the sum of the monthly and annual contract values for contracts sold during a period for our monthly and annual customers, respectively. We calculate organizational dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the trailing 12 months of bookings from the cohort of all domain-based customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period Bookings”). We then calculate the trailing 12 months of bookings from these same customers as of the current period end (“Current Period Bookings”). Current Period Bookings includes any upsells and is net of contraction or attrition, but excludes bookings from new domain-based customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period Bookings by the total Prior Period Bookings to arrive at the organizational dollar-based net retention rate. Key Business Metrics We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our business plan and make strategic decisions. Paying users We define a paying user as an individual customer of our survey platform or form-based application, a seat within a SurveyMonkey Enterprise deployment or a subscription to one of our purpose-built solutions, in each case as of the end of a period. One person would count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one paid license at the end of the period. For example, if an individual paying user also had a designated seat in a SurveyMonkey Enterprise deployment, we would count that person as two paying users. Paying users is an indicator of the scale of our business and an important factor in our ability to increase our revenue. Average revenue per paying user We define ARPU as revenue divided by the average number of paying users during the period. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. We calculate the average number of paying users by adding the number of paying users as of the end of the prior period to the number of paying users as of the end of the current period, and then dividing by two. We consider ARPU to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business by showing investors the changes in per-user revenue, which is a reflection of our ability to successfully upsell or cross-sell our products and purpose-built solutions. ARPU has limitations as an 47 analytic tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations of ARPU are that it is a calculation that does not reflect expenses that we incurred to generate revenue that is excluded from revenue. Non-GAAP Financial Measure We believe that, in addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, and capitalized internal-use software. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure because it measures our liquidity after deducting capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, which we believe provides a more accurate view of our cash generation and cash available to grow our business. We expect to generate positive free cash flow over the long term. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of free cash flow are that free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities: Free cash flow is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions to our software products for survey feedback and customer experience. We also generate a small portion of revenue from sales of subscriptions to our transactional market research solutions. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription term, generally ranging from one month to one year, as long as all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our contracts are generally non-cancellable and do not contain refund provisions. Subscription fees are collected primarily from credit cards through our website at the beginning of the subscription period. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses We allocate shared costs, such as depreciation on equipment shared by all departments, facilities (including rent and utilities), employee benefit costs and information technology costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category, other than restructuring. Cost of Revenue . Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products to our users. These expenses generally consist of infrastructure costs, personnel costs and other related costs. Infrastructure costs generally include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as data center equipment depreciation, facility costs (such as co-location rentals), amortization of capitalized software, payment processing fees, website hosting costs, external sample costs and charitable donations 48 associated with our SurveyMonkey Audience solution. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, other employee benefits and travel-related expenses for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Other related costs include amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and allocated overhead. We plan to continue investing in additional resources to enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our products. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue in the near term. We expect that cost of revenue will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. Research and Development . Research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs, costs for third-party consultants, depreciation of equipment used in research and development activities and allocated overhead. Personnel costs for our research and development organization include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, other employee benefits and travel-related expenses. Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining and enhancing existing products and adding new products. Except for costs associated with the application development phase of internal-use software, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue in the near term. We expect that research and development expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue in the long term. Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs, costs related to brand campaigns, paid marketing, amortization of acquired trade name and customer relationship intangible assets and allocated overhead. Personnel costs for our sales and marketing organization include salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, other employee benefits and travel-related expenses. Sales commissions earned by our sales personnel, including any related payroll taxes, that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a customer contract are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of generally four years. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will vary from period to period in the long term. General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs for legal, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as certain executives. Personnel costs for our general and administrative staff include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, other employee benefits and travel-related expenses. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, non-income-based taxes and allocated overhead. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue in the near term. We expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest on our credit facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018 (which was prior to our adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019), interest expense also included interest on financing obligations related to our corporate headquarters. For additional information regarding our credit facilities, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net Other non-operating (income) expense, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains and losses, gain on sale of private company investments and other gains and losses. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions that we have determined are not realizable on a more likely than not basis. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 49 Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. Percentages presented in the following tables may not sum due to rounding. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 50 Revenue and cost of revenue Revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Paying users increased 14% from approximately 720,900 as of December 31, 2019 to approximately 820,300 as of December 31, 2020 and ARPU increased 8% from $450 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $487 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase of $42.5 million, or 65%, in our Enterprise sales channel. Enterprise sales accounted for 29% and 21% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included approximately $2.1 million of non-recurring revenue from a one-time SurveyMonkey Audience customer and incremental revenue contributions from our acquisition of GetFeedback and Usabilla. In addition, revenue from our self-serve channel grew $25.7 million, or 11%, driven by a combination of demand arising from use cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as ongoing refinement of our paywalls that has driven an increase in customers upgrading to paid plans. Revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Paying users increased 11% from approximately 646,700 as of December 31, 2018 to approximately 720,900 as of December 31, 2019 and ARPU increased 11% from $406 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $450 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase of $31.9 million, or 95%, in our Enterprise sales channel. Enterprise sales accounted for 21% and 13% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 also included incremental revenue contributions from our acquisitions of GetFeedback and Usabilla. Cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in website hosting costs and payment processing fees, a $2.3 million increase in external sample costs and charitable donations associated with our SurveyMonkey Audience solution all due to increased sales, and a $2.1 million increase in amortization of intangible assets due to our prior acquisitions, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in capitalized software amortization. Cost of revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to $1.5 million decrease in personnel costs and lower capitalized software amortization of $6.1 million , partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in amortization of intangible assets due to our prior acquisitions as well as a $3.1 million increase in payment processing fees and website hosting costs due to increased sales. The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a $5.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation as the year ended December 31, 2018 included the cumulative catch-up of stock based compensation recognized upon the completion of our IPO, offset by an increase of $3.5 million in employee-related expenses due to headcount growth. Our gross margin increased for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 relative to the respective prior year period primarily due to the increases in revenue. Research and development Research and development expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $20.0 million increase in personnel related costs due to headcount growth and a decrease in the software development costs that qualified for capitalization of $3.9 million, offset by decreases in travel expenses due to suspension of all business-related travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 51 Research and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 3 1 , 2019 compared to the year ended December 3 1 , 2018, primarily due to a $ 18.1 million decrease in personnel costs, offset by a $ 3.1 million increase in facilities costs due to the adoption of ASC 842 (where lease payments for our San Mateo building lease are now accounted for as lease expense rather than as interest expense) . The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a $ 27.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation as the year ended December 31 , 2018 included the cumulative catch-up of stock based compensation recognized upon the completion of our IPO, offset by an increase of $ 8.9 million in employee-related expenses due to headcount growth. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $28.5 million increase in personnel-related costs due to headcount growth, an increase of $14.2 million in costs related to brand campaigns and paid marketing and a $1.5 million increase in amortization of intangible assets due to our prior acquisitions. In addition, there were increases in our facilities, IT costs and other expenses, offset by decreases in travel expenses due to suspension of all business-related travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales and marketing expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $14.4 million increase in personnel costs, an increase of $4.6 million in costs related to brand campaigns and paid marketing, a $5.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the adoption of ASC 842 (where lease payments for our San Mateo building lease are now accounted for as lease expense rather than as interest expense) and a $1.3 million increase in amortization of intangible assets due to our prior acquisitions. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in employee-related expenses due to headcount growth, offset by a $7.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation as the year ended December 31, 2018 included the cumulative catch-up of stock based compensation recognized upon the completion of our IPO. General and administrative General and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in personnel related costs, offset by a $1.0 million decrease in travel expenses due to suspension of all business-related travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and decreases in outside legal, accounting and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $25.0 million decrease in personnel costs, partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in outside legal, accounting and other professional fees related to being a public company and the acquisition of Usabilla and GetFeedback. The decrease in personnel costs was primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation as the year ended December 31, 2018 included the cumulative catch-up of stock based compensation recognized upon the completion of our IPO, offset by an increase of $6.6 million in employee-related expenses due to headcount growth. In addition, there were also increases to our lease, IT costs and other expenses. Interest expense Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances from our repayment of principal. For additional information regarding our credit facilities, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 52 Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31 , 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 , 2018, primarily due to lower debt balances during the year ended December 31 , 2019 relative to the prior year and the adoption of ASC 842 (where the financing obligation on our leased facility was derecognized thereby reducing interest expense comparatively ). For additional information regarding our credit facilities, see Note 1 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K . Other non-operating (income) expense, net Other non-operating income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $2.2 million resulting from lower interest rates. Other non-operating income, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (where other non-operating amounts resulted in net expense), primarily due to an increase in interest income of $1.9 million resulting from higher average cash balances and lower foreign currency losses of $1.1 million. In addition, non-operating income increased relative the prior year period due to the decrease in loss on debt extinguishment of $0.9 million recognized during year ended December 31, 2018. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes The provision for income taxes increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to taxes incurred in connection with a taxable sale of intangible assets and the partial release of the valuation allowance in 2019 as a result of our prior acquisitions. The benefit from income taxes increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the tax benefits of foreign losses and partial release of the valuation allowance as a result of our prior acquisitions . 53 Quarterly Results of Operations The following tables show a summary of our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the four quarters of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The unaudited quarterly statements of operations data set forth below have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented, in accordance with GAAP. Our historical quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in any future period and the unaudited quarterly statements of operations data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Percentages presented in the following tables may not sum due to rounding. 54 Quarterly Revenue and Gross Margin Trends Our revenue in each of the quarters presented increased due to increases in the number of paying users and in ARPU. Revenue growth was driven primarily by our Enterprise sales channel. In 2020, revenue from our self-serve channel increased due to demand arising from use cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our 2020 revenues increased year-over-year due to the incremental revenue contributions from our acquisitions of Usabilla and GetFeedback in 2019. Our gross margins increased in each of the quarters presented increased primarily due to the increase in revenue. Quarterly Operating Expenses Trends Our quarterly operating expenses have generally increased on a year-over-basis primarily due to increases in personnel costs, the timing and costs of our product development cycles, marketing programs and professional services costs. Our total costs and expenses have generally increased for the periods presented driven by higher employee related expenses primarily due to the addition of headcount in connection with the expansion of our business. The increases are also partially due to increases in paid marketing programs and amortization of intangible assets due to our prior acquisitions. In addition, the expense increases in 2020 were partially offset by decreases in travel related expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our interest expense decreased due to lower effective interest rates and partial repayment on our debt. Seasonality We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into subscription agreements with customers. We typically enter into a lower percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, during the summer months and during the holiday season in the second and fourth quarter of each year. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $224.4 million and $131.0 million, respectively, all of which were bank deposits as well as cash to be received from customers and cash available under our credit facilities. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through payments received from our customers, borrowings under credit facilities and lines of credit, and our initial public offering in 2018. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and cash provided by sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our 55 future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of cash received from customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings and the continuing market adoption of our products. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations. Additionally, we believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. We will continue to assess our liquidity needs as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations continues to evolve. Ongoing worldwide business and economic disruptions could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. A significant majority of our customers pay in advance for annual subscriptions, which is a substantial source of cash. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which we recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred revenue of $170.6 million and $141.0 million, respectively, a substantial majority of which we expect to record as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions to our products. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses and third-party hosting costs. Historically, we have generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $55.6 million, primarily due to our net loss of $91.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $142.8 million and net cash inflows of $4.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, bad debt expense and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to cash provided by an $29.7 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $7.9 million increase in accrued compensation, partially offset by cash used for prepaid expenses and other assets of $12.1 million and operating lease liabilities of $14.6 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $7.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $54.7 million, primarily due to our net loss of $73.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $113.5 million and net cash inflows of $15.0 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, bad debt expense and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to cash 56 provided by an $ 31 . 2 million increase in deferred revenue , a $ 8 . 3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities , and a $2.2 million increase in accrued compensation , partially offset by cash used for prepaid expenses and other assets of $ 5 . 1 million and operating lease liabilities of $ 13 . 9 million, and a n increase in accounts receivable of $ 7 . 7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $45.4 million, primarily due to our net loss of $154.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $184.1 million and net cash inflows of $16.0 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, bad debt expense and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to cash provided by a $16.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $5.2 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.6 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by cash used for prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.6 million, as well as an increase in accounts receivable of $2.2 million and a decrease of $1.4 million in accrued interest on financing lease obligation. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures to purchase equipment necessary to support our data center facilities and our network and other operations and capitalization of internal-use software necessary to deliver significant new features and functionality in our survey platform which provides value to our customers. As our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to increase. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $8.9 million was primarily attributable to cash used for the development of internal-use software of $9.2 million that is capitalized and purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment in privately-held company and other property of $1.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $128.1 million was primarily attributable to the net cash paid for the acquisitions of $114.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $2.5 million to support additional office space and headcount, and cash used for the development of internal-use software of $12.0 million that is capitalized, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a private company investment of $1.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $21.0 million was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment of $10.0 million to support additional office space and headcount, and the capitalization of internal-use software costs of $12.0 million associated with the development of additional features and functionality of our platform, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a private company investment of $1.0 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $46.7 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $42.2 million and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan of $6.7 million, partially offset by the principal payments on our credit facilities of $2.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $50.8 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $47.7 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $5.3 million, partially offset by the principal payments on our credit facilities of $2.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $95.5 million was primarily attributable to aggregate net proceeds from the completion of our IPO of $232.5 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.5 million, offset by $7.2 million in payments related to deferred offering costs, cash paid of $25.8 million for the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of RSUs, principal payments on our credit facilities of $104.1 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $0.5 million. 57 Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under our credit facilities and leases for office space. As of December 31, 2020, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these judgements, estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our judgements and estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting judgements and estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss below. Revenue Recognition We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our software products for survey feedback and customer experience. The revenue we generate from transactional market research solutions services is not significant. We normally sell each of these products in separate contracts to our customers and each product is distinct. The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations. Our policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of our subscription agreements. We account for revenue contracts with customers through the following steps: 58 For subscription products, we provide customers the option of monthly, annual or multi-year contractual terms. In general, our customers elect contractual terms of one year or less. Subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related subscription term beginning on the date we provide access. Access to our subscription product is an obligation representing a series of distinct services (and which comprise a single performance obligation) that we provide to our end customer over the subscription term. We recognize our subscription revenue on a straight-line basis because the customer benefits from access to our products throughout the subscription term. The transactional market research solution services are billed in advance and revenue is recognized after the services have been delivered. Our contracts are generally non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions and are billed in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. We record contract liabilities to deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of customer billings. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees, including restricted stock units, stock options, restricted stock awards, and shares issuable under our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . For time-based equity awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period, which is generally four years for new hires and generally three years for subsequent grants to existing employees. For shares issuable under the ESPP, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period, which is an offering period. We recognize the fair value of our performance-based RSUs using the accelerated attribution method. We recognize excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense in earnings, which are substantially offset by a valuation allowance. We also made a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair values of restricted stock units (including those that are performance-based) and restricted stock awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We estimate the fair values of our stock options and shares issuable under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Determining the grant date fair value of stock options and shares issuable under the ESPP requires management to make assumptions and judgments. If any of the assumptions used in the valuation models change significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. The assumptions and estimates are as follows: Our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of the grant, for which there are no estimates or judgements. Changes in the input assumptions outlined above can affect the fair value estimates used to measure stock-based compensation expense to be recognized. 59 Business Combination s When we acquire a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users including related attrition rates, acquired developed technology including the estimated obsolescence of the technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, future expected cash flows for operating expenses, useful lives and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to non-operating (income) expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds our implied fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually on October 1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Acquisition intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships and trade names. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful lives following the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed, generally straight-line. We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of amortizable long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that acquisition intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the amortizable long-lived assets in measuring whether they are recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset, a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Determining if an impairment triggering event has occurred (which may include, but is not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows) requires significant management judgement. We did not recognize any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.","The company was founded in 1999 and is a leader in agile software solutions that help companies turn stakeholder feedback into action. The company’s platform empowers users to collect, analyze, and act on feedback from customers, employees, website and app users, and market research audiences. SurveyMonkey’s products enable more than 345,000 organizations to deliver better customer experiences, increase employee retention, and unlock growth and innovation. The company offers SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillars—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research.
The company generates substantially all of its revenue from the sale of subscriptions to its products. The company’s current product portfolio is structured into three primary product pillars—Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research.
 	•	Surveys: The company’s leading survey software products enable its customers to measure, benchmark, and act on stakeholder feedback, and the company has designed its products to optimize the quality of stakeholder feedback and maximize response rates. The company offers its basic survey plan to individuals at no charge. The company also offers multiple tiers of subscriptions to individual paying users and teams which provide basic integrations with third-party applications and other additional features and functionality. For organizations the company offers an enterprise-grade version of its survey platform and purpose-built solutions with enhanced collaboration, integration, administration, and customization tools. Revenue from the Surveys pillar is generated primarily on a subscription basis.

 	•	Customer Experience: The company’s Customer Experience offering, the GetFeedback CX platform, enables companies to deliver exceptional experiences that engage and retain their customers based on the ability to continuously listen and act on digital feedback. GetFeedback captures a company’s customer feedback from across digital channels, analyzes this feedback for a deeper understanding of their customers and their preferences, and automates feedback-based actions through integrations with that company’s existing system of record. The company differentiates its Customer Experience offering in the market based on its software’s ease-of-implementation, ease-of-use, price-to-value, and time-to-value relative to alternative solutions, and third-party platform integrations. Revenue from its Customer Experience pillar is generated primarily on a subscription basis.

 	•	Market Research: The company’s Market Research offerings enable customers to quickly collect and analyze feedback on a number of market research projects, including analyzing target markets, measuring brand awareness, and gaining insights on existing and future product lines. Revenue from the Market Research pillar is generated primarily on a transactional basis.

The company reviews a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting its business, formulate its business plan and make strategic decisions.
Paying users
The company defines a paying user as an individual customer of the survey platform or form-based application, a seat within a SurveyMonkey Enterprise deployment or a subscription to one of the company’s purpose-built solutions, in each case as of the end of a period. One person would count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one paid license at the end of the period. For example, if an individual paying user also had a designated seat in a SurveyMonkey Enterprise deployment, the company would count that person as two paying users. Paying users is an indicator of the scale of its business and an important factor in the ability to increase the company’s revenue.
Average revenue per paying user: the company defines ARPU as revenue divided by the average number of paying users during the period. For interim periods, the company uses annualized revenue which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. The company calculates the average number of paying users by adding the number of paying users as of the end of the prior period to the number of paying users as of the end of the current period, and then dividing by two. The company considers ARPU to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in its business by showing investors the changes in per-user revenue, which is a reflection of its ability to successfully upsell or cross-sell its products and purpose-built solutions.

The company derives a substantial majority of its revenue from sales of subscriptions to its software products for survey feedback and customer experience. The company also generates a small portion of revenue from sales of subscriptions to its transactional market research solutions.
The company’s cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of its products to the company’s users. These expenses generally consist of infrastructure costs, personnel costs and other related costs. Infrastructure costs generally include expenses related to the operation of the company’s data centers, such as data center equipment depreciation, facility costs (such as co-location rentals), amortization of capitalized software, payment processing fees, website hosting costs, external sample costs and charitable donations associated with the company’s SurveyMonkey Audience solution. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, other employee benefits and travel-related expenses for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting its infrastructure and delivering user support.
Revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Paying users increased 14% from approximately 720,900 as of December 31, 2019 to approximately 820,300 as of December 31, 2020 and ARPU increased 8% from $450 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $487 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase of $42.5 million, or 65%, in the company’s Enterprise sales channel. Enterprise sales accounted for 29% and 21% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included approximately $2.1 million of non-recurring revenue from a one-time SurveyMonkey Audience customer and incremental revenue contributions from the acquisition of GetFeedback and Usabilla. In addition, revenue from its self-serve channel grew $25.7 million, or 11%, driven by a combination of demand arising from use cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as ongoing refinement of its paywalls that has driven an increase in customers upgrading to paid plans.
Cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in website hosting costs and payment processing fees, a $2.3 million increase in external sample costs and charitable donations associated with the company’s SurveyMonkey Audience solution all due to increased sales, and a $2.1 million increase in amortization of intangible assets due to the company’s prior acquisitions, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in capitalized software amortization.
The company’s gross margin increased for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 relative to the respective prior year period primarily due to the increases in revenue.
Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances from the company’s repayment of principal.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company’s principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $224.4 million and $131.0 million, respectively, all of which were bank deposits as well as cash to be received from customers and cash available under its credit facilities.
Since the company’s inception, the company has financed its operations primarily through payments received from its customers, borrowings under credit facilities and lines of credit, and its initial public offering in 2018.
The company’s largest source of operating cash is cash collections from its customers for subscriptions to its products. The company’s primary uses of cash in operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses and third-party hosting costs. Historically, the company have generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the company’s net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $55.6 million, primarily due to the net loss of $91.6 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $142.8 million and net cash inflows of $4.4 million provided by changes in the company’s operating assets and liabilities.
The company’s primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures to purchase equipment necessary to support its data center facilities and the company’s network and other operations and capitalization of internal-use software necessary to deliver significant new features and functionality in the company’s survey platform which provides value to its customers. As the company’s business grows, the company expects its capital expenditures to continue to increase.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $8.9 million was primarily attributable to cash used for the development of internal-use software of $9.2 million that is capitalized and purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment in privately-held company and other property of $1.1 million.
Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $46.7 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $42.2 million and shares purchased under the company’s employee stock purchase plan of $6.7 million, partially offset by the principal payments on its credit facilities of $2.2 million.

The following table illustrates the growth in selected HR product offerings: (1) Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. We continue to make investments in technology a priority as companies look to leverage technology solutions to maintain operations, stay connected to employees, and increase productivity. In fiscal 2021, we enhanced our solutions to support businesses as they navigate the federal stimulus programs and engage in digital transformation. We have continued to evolve our products to help business leaders find, hire, and retain employees quickly and effectively with an eye on driving engagement and managing labor costs. Our fiscal 2021 technology and solution developments provide a unique combination of data, technology, and service designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and employees, and include:  Portfolio of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) tools, which include the ability for employers to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”). This portfolio contains resources to help small businesses navigate complex regulations and evaluate business decisions during this challenging time as well as tools for PPP loan applications, including access to small business loan providers, and signature-ready PPP loan forgiveness applications. We have continued to update these tools in near real-time throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in response to changes in regulations.  Employee health and safety offerings, including a COVID-19 leave tracking tool to identify employee-submitted issues, a COVID-19 screening tool to give employers a way to initiate employee COVID-19 screenings and track test results within a single platform, and health attestation solutions which enable employers to customize and 21 digitally distribute a health attestation form to employees daily, securely store responses in real-time, and view advanced analytics for individuals or the entire workforce.  Digital communication solutions, including Paychex Flex HR Connect and HR Conversations, which helps strengthen connections and keep workers engaged no matter their work location. Paychex Flex HR Connect provides the ability to digitally submit questions, requests, and incidents directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow. HR Conversations enables managers, employees, and HR staff to initiate communications with employees and enhancements to performance assessments allow for 360-degree feedback digitally within the tool.  Pooled Employer Plan, which provides business owners with a plan option that relieves the compliance and administration burdens of a traditional 401(k) plan, giving their employees access to a retirement plan benefit and allowing them to prepare for their future.  Clover ® Integration, which streamlines payroll and time and attendance management for business owners using the popular Clover platform from Fiserv. With Paychex Flex available in the Clover App Market, business owners can more efficiently manage the essential tasks of payroll, staffing, time tracking, and scheduling all within a single application to help save time, increase accuracy, and reduce cost.  Paychex Flex Labor Cost Hub, which gives customers and CPAs a holistic, real-time view of total payroll labor job costing and labor distribution in one place, enabling them to see how much they are spending on a significant operational expense - their workforce.  Enhanced Onboarding Self-Service experience, which simplifies the user experience for entering and reviewing new-hire information and includes the ability to invite employees to complete onboarding and documentation digitally.  Enhancements to data analytics and Live Reports throughout the Platform. For example, the Diversity and Equal Pay Live Report builds upon a recently released Equal Employment Opportunity-1 compliance solution and gives administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data via a simple, customizable report. With improved access to this critical data, businesses are better positioned to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce, while also meeting compliance requirements.  PEO Protection Plus Package reduces risks for business owners by offering insurance coverage related to cyberattacks and employee lawsuits. By offering both Cyber Liability and Employment Practices Liability Insurance coverage as part of our PEO solution, and by leveraging the group plan model of our PEO, the coverage is significantly more affordable to businesses. We continue to strengthen our position in the industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, businesses of all sizes, and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance , helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage. Both this website and www.paychex.com/worx have sections dedicated to the topic of health care reform. COVID-19 Update As the global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, our priority has been, and continues to be, the health and safety of our employees. A portion of our workforce that initially transitioned to work remotely has voluntarily returned to the office. As vaccination levels continue to increase and masking and social distancing guidelines further relax, we look forward to welcoming more of our employees back to their office locations. We currently anticipate a general return to the office in September 2021, with a greater level of flexibility in response to the feedback our employees have shared with us. As our clients continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to helping them adapt and thrive, not only through the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the transition to the future business environment. We have brought a multifaceted response to the pandemic and delivered resources and services to help our clients respond and adapt. The COVID-19 Help Center on our website continues to provide support throughout every stage of the pandemic. Since the Help Center’s launch in March 2020, it has been viewed by over a half million visitors. On June 5, 2020, the PPP Flexibility Act was signed into law, relaxing the original requirements for how businesses could use PPP loans and continue to qualify for forgiveness. Within days of the bill passing, we introduced a PPP Loan Forgiveness Estimator and Forgiveness Report in our cloud-based HR suite, Paychex Flex, to simplify the application process for customers and provide them the accurate information needed to satisfy the new forgiveness requirements. As of May 31, 2021 , Paychex customers have secured $65 billion in PPP relief funds and $2.5 billion in combined employee retention tax credits and paid leave credits. As the global economy continues 22 to evolve, whether due to legislative changes, the pandemic, or other factors, we are committed to supporting our clients to help them navigate these challenges. Our blend of technology and service provides valuable tools and resources to assist our clients and their employees during this critical time and beyond. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our results and year-over-year comparisons, however, our client base continued to grow with sales performance and client retention that was at record levels. Our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility have allowed us to successfully manage through the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to date while protecting our cash flow and liquidity. In addition, during the first half of this fiscal year, we substantially completed cost-saving initiatives, including an acceleration of our long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization. We ended this year with strong momentum having navigated through a fiscal year of unprecedented challenge and the uncertain environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are well-positioned with a broad portfolio of innovative technology and products along with our unparalleled expertise to meet the continuing needs of businesses and help them succeed and thrive as they begin to bring employees back to work and adjust to the changes of how, where, and when work gets done. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of changes to the market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and will assess the potential impact on our business and financial position. Despite improving macroeconomic conditions and the emergence of vaccines, surges in COVID-19 cases, including variants of the strain, such as those recently experienced in Europe and the U.S., may cause people to self-quarantine or governments to shut down nonessential businesses again. We expect that the pandemic will continue to have an effect on our results, although the magnitude, duration, and full effects of the pandemic on our future results of operations or cash flows are not possible to predict at this time. For further information on the risks posed to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Results of Operations Summary of Results of Operations for Fiscal Years: (1) Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. n/m – not meaningful The changes in revenue as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors:  Management Solutions revenue: $3.0 billion for fiscal 2021, reflecting an increase of 2%: o Payroll client base growth of approximately 4%, due to solid sales performance and record client retention, and ‎ 23 o Increased penetration of our suite of solutions, including HR Solutions, Retirement Services, and Time and Attendance, and growth in ancillary products and services due to higher transaction volumes, offset by o Decline in check volumes experienced during the first three quarters of our fiscal year from an overall reduction in the number of clients processing payrolls due to lower employment levels during the pandemic.  PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue: $974.1 million for fiscal 2021, reflecting a decrease of 2%: o Decrease in the number of worksite employees at our clients in the first three quarters, offset by growth in the fourth quarter, and o Lower workers’ compensation premiums driven by reduced wages and softening of market rates, offset by o Increase in the number of health and benefit clients.  Interest on funds held for clients: $59.3 million for fiscal 2021, reflecting a decrease of 32%: o Lower average interest rates, due to historically low federal funds rates, and o Lower realized gains, which primarily resulted from our decision to strategically reposition our client fund portfolio at the end of fiscal 2020 to enhance liquidity in response to the economic uncertainties caused by COVID-19. o Average investment balances were consistent. We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2021, we had no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios are as follows: (1) The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $77.4 million as of July 14, 2021. (2) The Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.00% to 0.25% as of both May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020. (3) These items exclude the impact of variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”), as they are tied to short-term interest rates. Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K for more information on changing interest rates. 24 Total expenses: The following table summarizes total combined cost of service revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal years: (1) Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. The changes in total expenses as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors:  Compensation-related expenses: $1.5 billion for fiscal 2021, reflecting a 3% increase: o Higher performance-based compensation due to stronger than anticipated performance in fiscal 2021 and unusually low performance-based compensation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by o Lower wage-related costs due to lower headcount. As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 15,000 employees as compared to approximately 15,800 employees at May 31, 2020.  PEO insurance costs : $352.1 million in fiscal 2021, reflecting a 5% increase: o Increase in workers’ compensation costs and claims estimates and expansion of health insurance offerings to more clients.  Depreciation and amortization: $192.0 million in fiscal 2021, reflecting an 8% decrease: o Lower amortization driven by intangible assets amortized using accelerated methodologies.  Cost-saving initiatives: $32.2 million in fiscal 2021: o Acceleration of our long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization. These initiatives will provide us ongoing savings in rent, facilities maintenance, and wage-related expenses.  Other expenses: $498.0 million in fiscal 2021, reflecting a 10% decrease: o Lower discretionary and facilities spend due to office closures and restrictions due to the pandemic. Operating income: Fiscal 2021 operating income was $1.5 billion and comparable to fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating income (1) of $1.5 billion, which excludes the impact of one-time costs, reflects an increase of 2% and higher adjusted operating margin (1) . Operating margin and adjusted operating margin are as follows: Fluctuations in these metrics were attributable to the factors previously discussed. Income taxes: Our effective income tax rate was 23.5% and 23.6% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rates in both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to the volume of stock option exercises and the associated employee stock-based compensation payments. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on income taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $1.1 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share was $3.03 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and $3.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2020. Refer to Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on dilutive shares outstanding. 25 Adjusted net income (1) was $1.1 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, reflecting an increase of 2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) was $3.04 per diluted share and $3.00 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively, reflecting an increase of 1%. (1) Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. GAAP measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. ‎ 26 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: A djusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA are summarized as follows: (1) Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) One-time costs and corresponding tax benefit recognized related to the acceleration of cost-saving initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization. These events are not expected to recur. (3) Net tax windfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management. (4) The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently. The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding. In addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA, are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. 27 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position as of May 31, 2021 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.1 billion. Total short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs, were $804.7 million as of May 31, 2021. Our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations. Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2021. Our positive cash flows for fiscal 2021 allowed us to support our business and pay dividends of approximately $909.0 million. We currently anticipate that cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2021, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2021 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment. Financing Short-term financing: We maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. The purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. We typically borrow on an overnight or short-term basis on our credit facilities. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our credit facilities. Details of our credit facilities are as follows: Amounts outstanding under the PNC credit facility as of May 31, 2021 remain outstanding as of the date of this report. Details of borrowings under each credit facility during the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 28 Short-term borrowings are primarily used for the settlement of client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have been invested in AFS securities allocated to our long-term portfolio. We expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs. However, if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in, but not limited to, Item 1A in this Form 10-K and other SEC filings, we may need to adjust our capital, operating, and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. Furthermore, if we determined the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us. Letters of credit: As of May 31, 2021, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $180.4 million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between June 2021 and July 2022. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2021 or as of May 31, 2021. Subsequent to May 31, 2021, letters of credit expiring in June 2021 were renewed through June 2022 . Long-term financing: We have borrowed $800.0 million through the issuance of long-term private placement debt (“Senior Notes”). Certain information related to the Senior Notes are as follows: Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our long-term financing. Other commitments: The Company has various long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021, which include:  operating leases for $127.4 million;  purchase obligations for $162.7 million;  workers’ compensation estimated obligations for $183.1 million; and  long-term Senior Notes debt obligations for $800.0 million, plus interest payments of $217.5 million. Refer to Notes I, N, and Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these areas. The liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately $20.4 million as of May 31, 2021. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability. We are involved in two limited partnership agreements and committed to contribute a maximum amount of $20.0 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector. As of May 31, 2021, we have contributed approximately $12.0 million of the total funding commitment. The timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined. Our investments in venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations, are accounted for under the equity method, and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of May 31, 2021. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. 29 We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health and medical benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2021. We also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company. Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities The changes in our cash flows for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were primarily the result of the following key drivers: Operating Cash Flow Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $180.6 million.  Increases in purchased receivable balances in fiscal 2021 due to our clients’ continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in our business; and  Timing of estimated income tax payments. Payments normally due in fiscal 2020 were deferred until fiscal 2021 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act; offset by,  Increases in accrued worksite employee compensation as PEO clients’ employees returned to work; and  Increases in accrued corporate compensation due to higher performance-based compensation in fiscal 2021. Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash used in investing activities increased $1.2 billion.  Increases in Client Fund Assets as clients continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic;  At the end of fiscal 2020, we increased our liquidity by selling AFS securities due to the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the market and our business. As economic conditions improved throughout fiscal 2021, we started to opportunistically reposition back into AFS securities, and  Reduced availability of targeted high quality VRDNs in the market led to fewer AFS securities held and more cash equivalent balances during fiscal 2021. Fluctuations in the net purchases and sales/maturities of AFS securities are also due to timing within the client funds portfolio and market conditions. Specific timing items impacting cash flows for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations. Amounts will vary based upon the timing of collection from clients, and the related remittance to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K. Financing Cash Flow Activities Cash used in financing activities decreased $851.8 million. 30  Increases in client fund obligations in fiscal 2021 was due to our clients’ continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the Federal holiday. Funds collected on Friday May 28, 2021 were not remitted to client employees or tax and regulatory agencies until June 2021;  Cash flows from equity-based plans increased largely due to higher proceeds from the exercise or vesting of stock awards. 2.7 million shares of our common stock were exercised or vested in fiscal 2021 compared to 1.5 million shares in fiscal 2020;  During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we repurchased 1.7 million shares and 2.0 million shares, respectively. As of May 31, 2021, $72.4 million remains available under the common stock repurchase program. Refer to Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities contained in Item 5 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our common stock repurchase programs, and  Dividend payments increased in fiscal 2021 due to a 6% increase in our dividend rate beginning in May 2021. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flows and is subject to the discretion of our Board. The client fund obligations liability will also vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. Other Recently issued accounting pronouncements: Refer to Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 31 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue recognition: Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry via the purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 45 days. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. We receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. Advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists. PEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue. Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts: We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. The Company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. We determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations. The assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. We regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 or May 31, 2020. 32 PEO insurance reserves: As part of our PEO solution, we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates. With respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2021 or 2020. Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. A qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2021 and 2020, to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2021 or 2020. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance. We also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2021 or 2020. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2021 or 2020. Stock-based compensation costs: All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model. We will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change. The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period. 33 We estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures. The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award. Refer to Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans. Income taxes: We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions. 34","Paychex, Inc. (“PI”)

PI is a leading human resource (“HR”) software and services company, offering HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. Within its human capital management (“HCM”) solutions, PI offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that allow its clients to meet their diverse HR and payroll needs.

The company’s portfolio of HCM and employee benefit-related services is disaggregated into two categories, (1) Management Solutions and (2) Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions.

PI’s mission is to be the leading provider of HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions by being an essential partner to small- and medium-sized businesses across the United States and parts of Europe. The company’s strategy focuses on providing industry-leading, integrated technology; increasing client satisfaction; expanding its leadership in HR; growing its client base; and engaging in strategic acquisitions.

The changes in revenue as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors:

Management Solutions revenue increased by 2% to  $3.0 billion for fiscal 2021, reflecting Payroll client base growth of approximately 4%, due to solid sales performance and record client retention, and increased penetration of PI’s suite of solutions, including HR Solutions, Retirement Services, and Time and Attendance, and growth in ancillary products and services due to higher transaction volumes, offset by decline in check volumes experienced during the first three quarters of the company’s fiscal year from an overall reduction in the number of clients processing payrolls due to lower employment levels during the pandemic.

PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 2% to $974.1 million for fiscal 2021, reflecting a decrease
in the number of worksite employees at the company’s clients in the first three quarters, offset by growth in the fourth quarter, and lower workers’ compensation premiums driven by reduced wages and softening of market rates, offset by an increase in the number of health and benefit clients.

PI invests in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and doesn’t utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2021, the company had no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments.

The changes in total expenses as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the compensation-related expenses, which increased by 3% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2021, reflecting higher performance-based compensation due to stronger than anticipated performance in fiscal 2021 and unusually low performance-based compensation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by lower wage-related costs due to lower headcount. As of May 31, 2021, PI had approximately 15,000 employees as compared to approximately 15,800 employees at May 31, 2020; PEO insurance cost of $352.1 million in fiscal 2021, reflecting a 5% increase due to an increase in workers’ compensation costs and claims estimates and expansion of health insurance offerings to more clients.

Fiscal 2021 operating income was $1.5 billion and comparable to fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, which excludes the impact of one-time costs, reflects an increase of 2% and higher adjusted operating margin.

Net income was $1.1 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share was $3.03 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and $3.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2020.
The company’s financial position as of May 31, 2021 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.1 billion. Total short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs, were $804.7 million as of May 31, 2021. PI’s primary source of cash is generated by the company’s ongoing operations. Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2021. PI’s positive cash flows for fiscal 2021 allowed the company to support its business and pay dividends of approximately $909.0 million. The company currently anticipates that cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2021, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support PI’s business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

"Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. For a discussion of our consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018, see “Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018” under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in our final prospectus dated September 17, 2020 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on September 18, 2020 (the “Final Prospectus”). For a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2018, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in the Final Prospectus. Overview Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Our platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run, and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had, on average, a global reach of approximately 2.7 billion monthly active end users, who consumed content created or operated with our solutions on over 20 platforms. In the fourth quarter of 2020, applications built with Unity were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month. Our platform consists of two distinct, but connected and synergistic, sets of solutions: Create Solutions and Operate Solutions. Our Create Solutions are used by content creators—developers, artists, designers, engineers, and architects—to create interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content. Content can be created once and deployed to more than 20 platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others. Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-user base, as well as run and monetize their content with the goal of optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs, while increasing the lifetime value of their end users. We launched our first game development engine in 2004, bringing together a set of tools, such as rendering, lighting, physics, sound, animation, and user interface, that were designed to address the challenges faced by most game developers. Prior to Unity, developers primarily created these tools individually and repetitively across different target platforms, which was an expensive and time-consuming process. Unity made game development easier and faster. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we built upon our history of innovation by achieving a number of milestones that secured our position as the leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content including those identified below. • MatchMaker, launched in March 2020, is now being used in games like Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout , Worms Rumble , and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond . 65 • We released MARS, which gives creators professional-grade workflows for augmented and virtual reality development, in the third quarter of 2020. • We launched our Cloud Content Delivery in September 2020, which offers an enterprise-grade, low-complexity Content Delivery Network (CDN) that helps game developers deliver live game content updates to the right users, at the right time. • We launched our LEGO microgame in September 2020, which is designed to put digital LEGO elements into the hands of new users to get them quickly building, customizing, and sharing their first 3D game in less than an hour. • Because of our deep partnerships with Microsoft and Sony Interactive Entertainment, our customers were able to launch new game titles on the same day as the new console launches that took place in November 2020. Titles made with Unity included The Falconeer and Morkredd , both Xbox X|S Console Exclusives, and Haven and Overcooked 2: All You Can Eat , for both PlayStation5 and Xbox X|S. Also in the fourth quarter, the release of Apple’s M1 chipset and the Microsoft HoloLens 2 Development Edition both included Unity technology deeply integrated, rounding out the variety of new platform types on which developers can deploy and operate real-time 3D applications. • In December 2020, we introduced Unity Forma, a purpose-built tool designed to streamline the creation of configurable, photorealistic digital marketing content and interactive 3D experiences. We continue to invest in research and development and to pursue selective acquisitions and partnerships in order to enhance and expand our platform. Impact of COVID-19 While our total revenue, cash flows, and overall financial condition have not been adversely impacted to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. Although we have and may continue to experience a modest adverse impact on our sales of Create Solutions, though our pipeline of customer opportunities for our Create Solutions was largely back to normal levels by the end of 2020, as well as our Strategic Partnerships, we have seen an increase in demand for our portfolio of products and services within Operate Solutions following the implementation of shelter-in-place orders to mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, which has resulted in higher levels of end-user engagement in Operate Solutions and an increase in revenue, along with a decrease in operating expense due to materially reduced travel and spending on events and facilities. However, this increased demand for our Operate Solutions and expense reduction will likely moderate over time, particularly as a vaccine becomes widely available, and as shelter-in-place orders and other related measures and community practices evolve. Further, as certain of our customers or partners experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations or revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, they may decrease or delay their spending, request pricing concessions, or seek renegotiations of their contracts, any of which may result in decreased revenue for us. In addition, we may experience customer losses, due to factors including bankruptcy or our customers ceasing operations, which may result in an inability to collect receivables from these customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also requiring or have required substantially all of our employees to work remotely to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees and the communities in which we operate, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. 66 The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the situation and the effects on our business and operations closely. We do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business or operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. Given the uncertainty, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. For additional details, refer to the section titled “Risk Factors.” Key Metrics We monitor the following key metrics to help us evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our growth, formulate goals and objectives, and make strategic decisions. Customers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Revenue We have a history of strong growth in our customer base. We focus on the number of customers that generated more than $100,000 of revenue in the trailing 12 months, as this segment of our customer base represents the majority of our revenue and revenue growth. We expect that trend to continue. We define a customer as an individual or entity that generated revenue during the measurement period. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer, even though we may enter into commercial agreements with multiple parties within that organization. We had 793 and 600 of such customers in the trailing 12 months as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, demonstrating our ability to grow our revenues with existing customers, and our strong and growing penetration of larger enterprises, including AAA gaming studios and large organizations in industries beyond gaming. While these customers represented the substantial majority of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for either year. Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate Our ability to drive growth and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our Create and Operate Solutions customers and to increase their use of our platform. We track our performance by measuring our dollar-based net expansion rate, which compares our Create and Operate Solutions revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods, calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. Our dollar-based net expansion rate as of a period end is calculated as current period revenue divided by prior period revenue. Prior period revenue is the trailing 12-month revenue measured as of such prior period end and includes revenue from all customers that contributed revenue during such trailing 12-month period. Current period revenue is the trailing 12-month revenue from these same customers as of the current period end. Our dollar-based net expansion rate includes the effect of any customer renewals, expansion, contraction, and churn but excludes revenue from new customers in the current period. Our dollar-based net expansion rate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was driven primarily by the sales of additional subscriptions and services to our existing Create Solutions customers, expanded usage among our existing Operate Solutions customers, and improvements in cross-selling our solutions to all of our customers. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, increased usage of Operate Solutions drove the improvement in our dollar-based net expansion rate. 67 The chart below illustrates our strong relationship with existing customers by presenting our dollar-based net expansion rate as of the end of each of the past eight quarters. Results of Operations The following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated (in thousands): 68 The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Revenue We derive revenue from Create Solutions, Operate Solutions, and Strategic Partnerships and Other. Create Solutions We generate Create Solutions revenue primarily through the sale of subscription fee arrangements for the use of our products and related support services. We offer subscription plans at various price points and recognize revenue over a service period that generally ranges from one to three years. We typically bill our customers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the size of the contract. As a result of billing our customers in advance, we record deferred revenue, and a portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue related to subscription and support agreements that we entered into during previous periods. We generate additional Create Solutions revenue from the sale of professional services to our subscription customers. These services primarily consist of consulting, integration, training and custom application and workflow development, and may be billed in advance or on a time and materials basis. Operate Solutions We generate Operate Solutions revenue through a combination of revenue-share and usage-based business models that we manage as a portfolio of products and services. 69 Our monetization products are primarily based on a revenue-share model. These products were introduced in 2014 as our first set of Operate Solutions products and currently account for a substantial majority of our Operate Solutions revenue. We recognize monetization revenue primarily when an end user installs an application after seeing an advertisement (contracted on a cost-per-install basis), and to a lesser extent when an advertisement starts (contracted on a cost-per-impression basis). Our revenue represents the amount we retain from the transaction we are facilitating through our Unified Auction. Actions by operating system platform providers or application stores such as Apple or Google may affect the manner in which we or our customers collect, use and share data from end-user devices. In June 2020, Apple announced plans to require applications using its mobile operating system, iOS, to affirmatively (on an opt-in basis) obtain an end user’s permission to “track them across apps or websites owned by other companies” or access their device’s advertising identifier for advertising and advertising measurement purposes, as well as other restrictions. The exact timing and manner in which these plans will be implemented and the effect on our revenue are not yet clear, but we expect these changes to adversely affect our revenue from our monetization products and potentially other Operate Solutions, and such impact could be material. We also provide cloud-based services to support the ongoing operation of games and applications. These include application hosting services, as well as end-user engagement tools and voice chat services. These services are generally sold based on usage and billed monthly in arrears. Some of our usage-based contracts include a minimum fixed-fee usage amount. We expect that our Operate Solutions beyond monetization, including cloud operations and hosting services, such as Multiplay, which we introduced in 2018, as well as Vivox and deltaDNA, both introduced in 2019, will grow as a percentage of our revenue in the long term as we further scale these newer products and services and as we launch additional solutions for gaming customers as well as customers in other industries. Strategic Partnerships and Other We generate Strategic Partnerships revenue primarily from partnership contracts with hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers. Typically, we recognize revenue from these contracts as services are performed. These partnerships are typically multi-year software development arrangements with payments that are either made in advance on a quarterly basis or milestone-based. In addition, certain partners pay us royalties based on the sales of applications sold on their platform that incorporate or use our customized software. We generate Other revenue primarily from our share of sales from our Asset Store, a marketplace and scaled aggregator for software, content, and tools used in the creation of real-time interactive games and applications, and from our Verified Solutions Partners, which sell software and tools certified for quality and compatibility with our platform. 70 Our total revenue is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): The increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was substantially due to revenue growth among existing customers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our Create Solutions and Operate Solutions, including an increase of approximately $25 million as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offsetting a decrease in Strategic Partnership revenue primarily due to deal delays resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the retirement of certain partners' product offerings. Create Solutions revenue growth was positively impacted by the second quarter 2020 Finger Food acquisition, offset in part from a slowdown of sales cycles due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, though we saw signs of recovery beginning in the second half of the year. The pandemic-related slowdown of sales cycles initially began in Asia during the first quarter of 2020 and was followed by geographies outside of Asia in the second quarter of 2020. Within Operate Solutions, the substantial majority of our revenue growth was driven by an increase in revenue per customer as customers increased their usage across our Operate portfolio of products and services due in part to the higher levels of end-user engagement as a result of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin Cost of revenue consists primarily of hosting expenses, personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for employees associated with our product support and professional services organizations, allocated overhead (including facilities, information technology, and security costs), third party license fees, and credit card fees, as well as amortization of related capitalized software and depreciation of related property and equipment. Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including our product mix, the costs associated with third-party hosting services, and the extent to which we expand and drive efficiencies in our hosting costs, professional services, and customer support organizations. We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars, but we expect our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, to fluctuate from period to period. Our cost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margin are summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to an increase of $21.8 million in hosting costs supporting our growth in our Create Solutions and Operate Solutions, as well as an increase of $24.7 million in personnel-related and professional services expenses to support our Create Solutions and Strategic Partnerships. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also driven by an increase in headcount, and a one-time cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied upon completion of our IPO. 71 Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The most significant component of our operating expenses is personnel-related costs, including salaries and wages, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation, and payroll taxes. We estimate that materially reduced travel and spending on events and facilities due to COVID-19 protocols and precautions reduced our operating expenses by approximately $40 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. These savings are unlikely to be repeated in future years. Research and Development Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs for the design and development of our platform, third-party software services, professional services, and allocated overhead. We expense research and development expenses as they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we expand our teams to develop new products, expand features and functionality with existing products, and enter new markets. Research and development expense is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to an increase of $123.8 million in personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount to support continued product innovation, and a one-time cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $25.2 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied upon completion of our IPO. In addition, IT hosting expense increased by $13.0 million due to growing data and compute needs. Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs; advertising and marketing programs, including digital account-based marketing, user events such as developer-centric conferences and our annual Unite user conferences; and allocated overhead. We expect that our sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel, increase our account-based marketing, direct marketing and community outreach activities, invest in additional tools and technologies, and continue to build brand awareness. Our expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period. Sales and marketing expense is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to an increase of $43.9 million in personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount to support the growth of our sales and marketing teams and a one-time cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $7.9 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied upon completion of our IPO. In addition, marketing and advertising expense increased by $9.2 million due to new product initiatives. This increase was partially offset by an $11.7 million reduction in conference and event expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 72 General and Administrative Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs for finance, legal, human resources, and administrative employees; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other professional services; and allocated overhead. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we scale to support the growth of our business. General and administrative expense is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to a one-time charge of $63.6 million related to the donation of 750,000 shares of our common stock to a charitable foundation. In addition, personnel-related costs increased by $39.8 million, driven by an increase in headcount to support the growth of our general and administrative teams and also included a one-time cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $10.7 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied upon completion of our IPO. Interest Expense Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Agreement. Interest expense is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Interest expense was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 on the outstanding balance from our $125.0 million credit facility, which was fully drawn in March 2020 and repaid in September 2020. We had no outstanding debt during 2019. Interest Income and Other Expense, Net Interest income and other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, amortization of premium arising at acquisition of marketable securities, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. As we have expanded our global operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this to continue. Interest income and other expense, net, is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Interest income and other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement losses and lower returns on our interest-bearing deposits as a result of lower interest rates. 73 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. As we have expanded our global operations, we have incurred increased foreign tax expense, and we expect this to continue. We have a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development. Our overall effective income tax rate in future periods may be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. See Note 14, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for income taxes is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased primarily due to a one-time intercompany transaction with our Finland subsidiary in the same period ended 2019. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance financial measures, as described below, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe, when taken collectively, they may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance. In the future, we may also exclude non-recurring expenses and other expenses that do not reflect our overall operating results. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Loss from Operations We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense and employer tax related to employee stock transactions. We define non-GAAP loss from operations as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer tax related to employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, and non-cash charitable contribution expense. We use non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP loss from operations in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP loss from operations provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics excludes stock-based compensation expense, employer tax related to employee stock tra nsactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, and non-cash charitable contribution expense, which we do not consider to be indicative of our overall operating performance. 74 Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP loss from operations have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • they exclude expense associated with our equity compensation plan, although equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, an important part of our compensation strategy; • non-GAAP loss from operations excludes the expense of amortization of acquired intangible assets, and although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being amortized may have to be replaced in the future and non-GAAP loss from operations does not reflect cash expenditure for such replacements; • non-GAAP loss from operations excludes the expense associated with the charitable contribution of common stock to a donor-advised fund, and although this is a non-cash expense, we may make similar charitable contributions in the future; and • the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP loss from operations may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from this measure or similarly titled measures, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP gross profit to our GAAP gross profit, the most directly comparable measure as determined in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in thousands): Non-GAAP gross margin was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP loss from operations to our GAAP loss from operations, the most directly comparable measure as determined in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in thousands): 75 A substantial part of the year-over-year improvement in our non-GAAP loss from operations was driven in part by savings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to travel, marketing, and facilities. Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss per Share We define non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share as net loss and net loss per share excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer tax related to employee stock transactions, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, and non-cash charitable contribution expense, as well as the related tax effects of these items. Non-GAAP net loss per share also adds back expense relating to deemed dividends representing excess paid over initial issuance price to repurchase convertible preferred stock. We use non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • they exclude expense associated with our equity compensation plan, although equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, an important part of our compensation strategy; • they exclude the expense of amortization of acquired intangible assets, and although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being amortized may have to be replaced in the future and non-GAAP loss from operations does not reflect cash expenditure for such replacements; • they exclude the expense associated with the charitable contribution of common stock to a donor-advised fund, and although this is a non-cash expense, we may make similar charitable contributions in the future; • as further described below, we must make certain assumptions in order to determine the income tax effect adjustment for non-GAAP net loss, which assumptions may not prove to be accurate; and • the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from this measure or similarly titled measures, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Income Tax Effects of Non-GAAP Adjustments We utilize a fixed projected tax rate in our computation of non-GAAP income tax effects to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods. In projecting this non-GAAP tax rate, we utilize a financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. The projected rate considers other factors such as our current operating structure, existing tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the non-GAAP tax rate was (17)%. 76 The following table presents a reconciliation of our non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to our GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss per share, respectively, which are the most directly comparable measures as determined in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data ): Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • it is not a substitute for net cash used in operating activities; • other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison; and • the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. 77 The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable measure as determined in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in thousands): The year-over-year increase in free cash flow was primarily due to strong performance within our Operate Solutions, as well as savings in operational expenses due to COVID-19. We expect our free cash flow to remain volatile from quarter to quarter and likely to decline in 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds we have received from the sales of our convertible preferred stock and common stock and through payments received from customers using our platform. As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1,752.0 million, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Since our inception, we have generated losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $797.5 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments we will continue to make in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. As a result, we may require additional capital to execute our strategic initiatives to grow our business. We believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our growth rate; the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts; capital expenditures to build out new facilities and purchase hardware and software; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; and our continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to support our growth. In addition, we may enter into additional strategic partnerships as well as agreements to acquire or invest in complementary products, teams and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which could increase our cash requirements. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we acquired three and six companies, respectively, with products and technologies that support our growth strategies, which reduced our December 31, 2020 and 2019 cash balance by $53.2 million and $192.5 million, respectively. As a result of these and other factors, we may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than we currently anticipate. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. 78 Our changes in cash flows were as follows (in thousands): Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020 , cash provided by operating activities was $19.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $282.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $244.5 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $57.8 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $43.0 million, stock-based compensation of $134.6 million, an d a common stock charitable donation expense of $63.6 million . The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $41.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $44.6 million increase in publisher payables, and a $37.4 million increase in deferred revenue. This was partially offset by a $63.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a $13.0 million increase in other current assets. A substantial portion of our accounts receivable balance comes from advertising partners and is offset by an accounts payable amount due to our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). However, the payment terms that we offer our advertising partners are generally shorter than the payment terms with our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). As such, our cash flows fluctuate from period to period due to revenue seasonality, timi ng of billings, collections, and publisher payments. Historical cash flows are not necessarily indicative of our results in any future period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $67.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $163.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $75.7 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $19.5 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $44.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $31.1 million. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $31.1 million increase in deferred revenue, an increase in publisher payables of $20.2 million, and a $13.2 million increase in income and other taxes payable. This was partially offset by a $49.4 million increase in accounts receivable, all due to an increase in sales, including in the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest quarter for new business within our Create Solutions business and for usage levels within our Operate Solutions business. Cash Used in Investing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020 , cash used in investing activities was $575.2 million, consisting of the purchase of marketable securities of $482.5 million, cash used in acquisitions of $53.2 million, and capital expenditures of $40.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $219.5 million, consisting of cash used in acquisitions of $192.5 million and capital expenditures of $27.0 million. 79 Cash Provided by Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $1,701.5 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds of $1,417.6 million from our initial public offering, net proceeds of $250.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, proceeds of $125.0 million from the revolving loan facility, and proceeds of $25.4 million from the exercise of stock options. The net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to the $125.0 million repayment of principal on our revolving loan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $161.5 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock of $585.1 million and stock option exercises of $11.8 million, partially offset by $435.1 million used for the repurchase of our stock and the purchase of shares of our common stock and vested stock options pursuant to a tender offer, and $0.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with our $125.0 million Credit Agreement. Contractual Obligations Th e following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): (1) Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for real estate. (2) The substantial majority of our purchase commitments are related to agreements with our data center hosting providers. (3) This table generally excludes amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any material holdings in variable interest entities as of December 31, 2020. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. 80 Re venue Recognition We generate revenue through three sources: (1) Create Solutions, which is composed primarily of our subscription offerings and professional services; (2) Operate Solutions, which includes our monetization services, hosting, and multiplayer services, and voice services; and (3) Strategic Partnerships and Other, which are primarily arrangements with strategic hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers for the customization and development of our software to enable interoperability with these platforms. We evaluate and recognize revenue by: • identifying the contract(s) with the customer; • identifying the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); • determining the transaction price; • allocating the transaction price to performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); and • recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer which we refer to as a transfer of control. Our contracts are generally non-cancellable. Once we have determined the transaction price, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or SSP. The determination of SSP for each distinct performance obligation requires judgment. Generally, we determine SSP using observable pricing, which takes into consideration market conditions and customer specific factors. When observable pricing is not available, we use cost plus margin analysis to determine SSP. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We use the output method for our Create Solutions and Operate Solutions contracts, and generally use the input method for our Strategic Partnership contracts. We determined that these methods are the most appropriate measure of progress as they faithfully represent when the value of the services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, and control is transferred. For advertisements placed through the Unified Auction, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenue on a gross basis) or the agent (i.e., report revenue on a net basis). The evaluation to present revenue on a gross versus net basis requires significant judgment. We have concluded that the publisher is our customer and we are the agent in facilitating the fulfillment of the advertising inventory in the Unified Auction primarily because we do not control the advertising inventory prior to the placement of an advertisement. Typically we do not retain a share of the revenue generated through Unity IAP (In-App Purchases). Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards. Restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted by us have a service condition, which is generally satisfied over four years, and RSUs granted prior to our IPO were also subject to a liquidity event vesting condition, which was satisfied on the completion of our IPO. Stock options granted by us only have a service vesting condition, which is generally a vesting period of four years. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. These assumptions and estimates are as follows: 81 • Fair Value of Common Stock—Because our common stock was not yet publicly traded prior to our IPO, we estimated the fair value of common stock, as discussed below in the section titled “—Common Stock Valuations.” • Expected term—The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, estimated exercise behavior, post-vesting cancellations and contractual lives of the awards. • Risk-free interest rates—The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yields in effect at the time of the grant of U.S. Treasury notes with terms approximately equal to the expected term of the award. • Expected stock price volatility—We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group as our common stock has only been publicly traded for a short period of time. • Expected dividend yield—Our expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock. Common Stock Valuations Prior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide: Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors along with management exercised its reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of fair value of our common stock, including: • the prices at which we or other holders sold our common and redeemable convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions; • independent third-party valuations of our common stock; • the rights, preferences and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; • our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources; • the industry outlook; • the valuation of comparable companies; • the lack of marketability of our common stock; • the fact that option and RSU grants have involved rights in illiquid securities in a private company; • the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company given prevailing market conditions; • the history and nature of our business, industry trends and competitive environment; and • general economic outlook including economic growth, inflation and unemployment, interest rate environment and global economic trends. Following the completion of our IPO, there is an active market for our common stock, so we no longer apply these valuation approaches. Accounting for Business Combinations The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. 82 Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies; • the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our product portfolio; • the expected use of the acquired assets; and • discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter of each calendar year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We use judgments when assessing qualitative factors of impairment that include macroeconomic conditions, other relevant events and factors affecting the market and industry, our financial performance, and other factors. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. We evaluate intangible assets other than goodwill for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other events that indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We use the asset and liability method under FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, when accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax asset and liability. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 83 We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. JOBS Act Accounting Election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with certain new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Pronouncements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.","Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. The company’s platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run, and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, USI had, on average, a global reach of approximately 2.7 billion monthly active end users, who consumed content created or operated with our solutions on over 20 platforms. In the fourth quarter of 2020, applications built with Unity were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month. The company’s platform consists of two distinct, but connected and synergistic, sets of solutions: Create Solutions and Operate Solutions. USI’s Create Solutions are used by content creators—developers, artists, designers, engineers, and architects—to create interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content. Content can be created once and deployed to more than 20 platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others. Its Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-user base, as well as run and monetize their content with the goal of optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs, while increasing the lifetime value of their end users. Because of the copany’s deep partnerships with Microsoft and Sony Interactive Entertainment, our customers were able to launch new game titles on the same day as the new console launches that took place in November 2020. Titles made with Unity included The Falconeer and Morkredd, both Xbox X|S Console Exclusives, and Haven and Overcooked 2: All You Can Eat, for both PlayStation5 and Xbox X|S. Also in the fourth quarter, the release of Apple’s M1 chipset and the Microsoft HoloLens 2 Development Edition both included Unity technology deeply integrated, rounding out the variety of new platform types on which developers can deploy and operate real-time 3D applications. The company continues to invest in research and development and to pursue selective acquisitions and partnerships in order to enhance and expand its platform.

The company derives revenue from Create Solutions, Operate Solutions, and Strategic Partnerships and Other.
-	Create Solutions: the company generates Create Solutions revenue primarily through the sale of subscription fee arrangements for the use of our products and related support services.
-	Operate Solutions: the company generates Operate Solutions revenue through a combination of revenue-share and usage-based business models that we manage as a portfolio of products and services
-	Strategic Partnerships and Other: USI generates Strategic Partnerships revenue primarily from partnership contracts with hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers. The company generates Other revenue primarily from its share of sales from our Asset Store, a marketplace and scaled aggregator for software, content, and tools used in the creation of real-time interactive games and applications, and from its Verified Solutions Partners, which sell software and tools certified for quality and compatibility with USI’s platform.
The increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was substantially due to revenue growth among existing customers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue from USI’s Create Solutions and Operate Solutions, including an increase of approximately $25 million as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offsetting a decrease in Strategic Partnership revenue primarily due to deal delays resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the retirement of certain partners' product offerings. Create Solutions revenue growth was positively impacted by the second quarter 2020 Finger Food acquisition, offset in part from a slowdown of sales cycles due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the company saw signs of recovery beginning in the second half of the year. The pandemic-related slowdown of sales cycles initially began in Asia during the first quarter of 2020 and was followed by geographies outside of Asia in the second quarter of 2020. Within Operate Solutions, the substantial majority of our revenue growth was driven by an increase in revenue per customer as customers increased their usage across our Operate portfolio of products and services due in part to the higher levels of end-user engagement as a result of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.
Cost of revenue consists primarily of hosting expenses, personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for employees associated with the company’s product support and professional services organizations, allocated overhead (including facilities, information technology, and security costs), third party license fees, and credit card fees, as well as amortization of related capitalized software and depreciation of related property and equipment.
Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including our product mix, the costs associated with third-party hosting services, and the extent to which the company expands and drives efficiencies in its hosting costs, professional services, and customer support organizations. Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to an increase of $21.8 million in hosting costs supporting our growth in our Create Solutions and Operate Solutions, as well as an increase of $24.7 million in personnel-related and professional services expenses to support our Create Solutions and Strategic Partnerships. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also driven by an increase in headcount, and a one-time cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs as the liquidity event vesting condition was satisfied upon completion of the company’s IPO.
USI’s operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The most significant component of the company’s operating expenses is personnel-related costs, including salaries and wages, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation, and payroll taxes. The company estimates that materially reduced travel and spending on events and facilities due to COVID-19 protocols and precautions reduced its operating expenses by approximately $40 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. These savings are unlikely to be repeated in future years. Interest expense was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 on the outstanding balance from the company’s $125.0 million credit facility, which was fully drawn in March 2020 and repaid in September 2020. USI had no outstanding debt during 2019.
The year-over-year increase in free cash flow was primarily due to strong performance within the company’s Operate Solutions, as well as savings in operational expenses due to COVID-19. The company expects its free cash flow to remain volatile from quarter to quarter and likely to decline in 2021.
Since inception, the company has financed its operations primarily through the net proceeds the company  has received from the sales of its convertible preferred stock and common stock and through payments received from customers using USI’s platform. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1,752.0 million, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Since its inception, the company has generated losses from its operations as reflected in the company’s accumulated deficit of $797.5 million as of December 31, 2020. USI expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments the company will continue to make in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. The company believes its existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company acquired three and six companies, respectively, with products and technologies that support USI’s growth strategies, which reduced our December 31, 2020 and 2019 cash balance by $53.2 million and $192.5 million, respectively. As a result of these and other factors, the company may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than it currently anticipates.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $19.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $282.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $244.5 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $57.8 million. Cash used in investing activities was $575.2 million, consisting of the purchase of marketable securities of $482.5 million, cash used in acquisitions of $53.2 million, and capital expenditures of $40.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $1,701.5 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds of $1,417.6 million from USI’s initial public offering, net proceeds of $250.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, proceeds of $125.0 million from the revolving loan facility, and proceeds of $25.4 million from the exercise of stock options. The net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to the $125.0 million repayment of principal on the company’s revolving loan facility.

"The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist the reader in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this ""Annual Report""). This Annual Report includes certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Annual Report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including matters having to do with expected and future revenue, our ability to fund our operations and repay debt, business strategies, expansion and growth of operations and other such matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by our management in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by us, our performance on our current contracts and our success in obtaining new contracts, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and those actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in such statements. Overview The Company is a SaaS provider, and the parent company of ReposiTrak, a B2B e-commerce, compliance, and supply chain management platform company that partners with retailers, wholesalers, and product suppliers to help them source, vet, and transact with their suppliers in order to accelerate sales, control risks, and improve supply chain efficiencies. The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2021 refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. -14- Sources of Revenue The principal customers for the Company’s products are multi-store retail chains, wholesalers and distributors, and their suppliers. The Company has a Hub and Spoke business model, whereby the Company is typically engaged by Hubs, which in turn require Spokes to utilize the Company’s services. The Company derives revenue from five sources: (i) subscription fees, (ii) transaction based fees, (iii) professional services fees, (iv) license fees, and (v) hosting and maintenance fees A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from its Supply Chain solutions and Compliance and Food Safety solutions in the form of recurring subscription payments from the suppliers. Subscription fees can be based on a negotiated flat fee per supplier, or some volumetric metric, such as the number of stores, or the volume of economic activity between a retailer and its suppliers. Subscription revenue contains arrangements with customers for use of the application, application and data hosting, maintenance of the application, and standard support. Revenue from the Company’s MarketPlace sourcing solution is transactional, based on the volume of products sourced via the application. MarketPlace revenue can come from several sources depending on the customer’s specific requirements. These include acting as an agent for a supplier, providing supply chain technology services, and enabling a Hub to reduce its number of new suppliers by acting as the supplier for any number of products. The Company also provides professional consulting services targeting implementation, assessments, profit optimization and support functions for its applications and related products , for which revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion or pro rata basis over the life of the subscription, depending on the nature of the engagement. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services and is available along with additional support services such as developer support and partner support for an addition fee. In some instances, the Company will sell its software in the form of a license. License arrangements are a time-specific and perpetual license. Software license maintenance agreements are typically annual contracts, paid in advance or according to terms specified in the contract. When sold as a license, the Company’s software, is usually accompanied by a corresponding Maintenance and/or Hosting Agreement to support the service. Software maintenance agreements provide the customer with access to new software enhancements, maintenance releases, patches, updates and technical support personnel. Our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers’ data, which is physically located in third-party facilities. Customers access ‘hosted’ software and data through a secure internet connection. Revenue Recognition Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and its related amendments (“ ASU 2014-09 ”). ASU 2014-09 provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized and enhances certain disclosure around the nature, timing, amount and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customers. ASU 2014-09 represents a change in the accounting model utilized for the recognition of revenue and certain expense arising from contracts with customers. We adopted ASU 2014-09 using a “modified retrospective” approach and, accordingly, revenue and expense totals for all periods before July 1, 2018 reflect those previously reported under the prior accounting model and have not been restated. -15- Other Metrics – Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements, historically we have provided investors with Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP income per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may provide useful information regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. These measures are also presented to our Board of Directors. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“ GAAP ”). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in this “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .” Critical Accounting Policies This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company’s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience of operations and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Income Taxes In determining the carrying value of the Company’s net deferred income tax assets, the Company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions, to realize the benefit of these assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance, resulting in an income tax benefit in the Company’s statements of operations. Management evaluates quarterly whether to realize the deferred income tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance. Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Valuations Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Management reviews the long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Management evaluates, at each balance sheet date, whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long-lived asset. Economic useful lives of long-lived assets are assessed and adjusted as circumstances dictate. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The Company records compensation expense on a straight-line basis. The fair value of any options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate. -16- Capitalization of Software Development Costs The Company accounts for research costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly after a working prototype is complete and meets or exceeds design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have been and will continue to be capitalized until such time as when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers. The Company capitalized software development costs of $171,733 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue and results of operation, liquidity or capital expenditures. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) – Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract . The amendments in this update apply to an entity who is a customer in a hosting arrangement accounted for as a service contract. The update requires a customer in a hosting arrangement to capitalize certain implementation costs. Costs associated with the application development stage of the implementation should be capitalized and costs with the other stages should be expensed. For instance, costs for training and data conversion should be expensed. The capitalized implementation costs should be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement, which is the noncancelable period plus periods covered by an option to extend if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Impairment of the capitalized costs should be considered similar to other intangibles. The effective date of this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities and after December 15, 2020 for all other entities with early adoption permitted. The Company is a customer in a hosting arrangement and may enter into new arrangements in the future. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This ASU eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in this update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. Prior to this update, equity-based payments to non-employees was accounted for under Subtopic 505-50 resulting in significant differences between the accounting for share-based payments to non-employees as compared to employees. One of the most significant changes is that non-employee share-based awards (classified as equity awards) may be measured at grant-date fair value and not have to be continually revalued until the service/goods are rendered. The update also indicates that share-based awards related to financing and awards granted to a customer in conjunction with selling goods or services are not included in Topic 718. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities and December 15, 2019 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity’s adoption date of Topic 606. The Company adopted the standard during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , which amends and simplifies the accounting standard for goodwill impairment. The new standard removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. -17- In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("" ASU 2016-02 ""). All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with this new standard with results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2019 presented under ASU 2016-02, while prior period amounts and disclosures are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 Revenue During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had revenue of $21,007,076 compared to $20,038,054 for the year ended June 30, 2020, a 5% increase. The increase in revenue was due to growth in both subscription revenue and Marketplace revenue, partially offset by approximately $145,500 in one-time license revenue that occurred in 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021. During fiscal 2021, as COVID-19 disrupted supply chains and generated shortages in products, our ability to source hard to find items for our customers resulted in increased revenue attributable to MarketPlace. These products largely consisted of personel protective equipment ("" PPE "") which includes nitrile gloves, masks, freezers and telecommunication equipment. While the Company has experienced a significant increase in Marketplace revenue for PPE during the height of COVID-19, it is uncertain whether demand for PPE will continue at the same level. As a result, we may experience reduced demand for MarketPlace attributable to PPE as the pandemic begins to abate. Cost of Services and Product Support Cost of services and product support was $6,884,647 or 33% of total revenue, and $ 6,997,424 or 35% of total revenue for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a 2 % decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) higher expense associated to MarketPlace and the sales of PPE; and (ii) an increase in hardware/software non-capitalized items required for updating our information systems security, maintaining equipment licensing and other database systems. While we have experienced a significant increase in Marketplace costs and corresponding revenue during the pandemic due to demand in PPE, it is unclear what level of ongoing Marketplace costs we may experience as the pandemic begins to abate. Sales and Marketing Expense -18- The Company’s sales and marketing expense was $4,995,578, or 24 % of total revenue, and $5,775,309, or 29% of total revenue, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a 14 % decrease. This decrease in sales and marketing expense is due primarily to a decrease in variable compensation, a reduction in trade show expense, and lower sales and marketing travel expense. General and Administrative Expense The Company’s general and administrative expense was $ 5,214,936 , or 25% of total revenue, and $ 4,948,443 or 25% of total revenue for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a 5 % increase. General and administrative expense increased year over year due to an increase in bad debt expense and higher insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by lower general overhead due to cost cutting measures and natural reductions due to our “work from home” status since April of 2020. Depreciation and Amortization Expense The Company’s depreciation and amortization expense was $1,019,515 and $838,866 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a 22 % increase. This increase is due to the expansion of new equipment for the Company’s information technology infrastructure, buildout of our corporate headquarters, and expansion of our data center completed in June 2020. Other Income and Expense Other income was $1,301,892 compared to $157,176 for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, a 728% increase. Other income increased due to recognition of a gain on debt extinguishment and higher interest income resulting from an increase of total cash held in short term investments offset in part by the increase in interest expense associated with financing arrangements for equipment purchased under a lease arrangement with a bank. The financing arrangement was paid off in August 2020. Preferred Dividends Dividends accrued on the Company’s Series B Preferred and Series B-1 Preferred was $568,444 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividends remained flat in the comparable periods. -19- Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, our rate of revenue growth, sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. We have historically funded our operations with cash from operations, equity financings, and borrowings from the issuance of debt, including our existing line of credit with U.S. Bank N.A. Cash was $24,070,322 and $20,345,330 at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This 18% increase is principally the result of growth in both software and MarketPlace revenue, collection of accounts receivable, and extinguished debt. Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities is summarized as follows: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $5,401,815 compared to net cash provided by in operating activities of $4,916,139 for the year ended June 30, 2020 . Net cash provided by operating activities increased 29% due largely to higher revenues and lower operating costs. Noncash expense decreased by $695,456 in the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to June 30, 2020 as a result of gain on debt extinguishment and an increase in depreciation and amortization offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense. Net Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $318,873 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $650,422 for the year ended June 30, 2020 . This decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to the buildout of new Murray, UT headquarters and expansion of our data center that was completed in 2020 that did not occur in the same period in 2021. -20- Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,357,950 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $ 1,809,810 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the August 2020 payoff of a financing arrangement with a bank partially offset by a decrease in our stock buyback program. Liquidity and Working Capital At June 30, 2021, the Company had positive working capital of $ 20,400,991 , as compared with positive working capital of $ 18,236,664 at June 30, 2020. This $ 2,164,327 increase in working capital is primarily due to an increase in cash resulting from higher revenue. Current assets as of June 30, 2021 totaled $29,701,774, an in crease of $2,552,863 , as compared to $27,148,911 as of June 30, 2020. The increase in current assets is primarily attributable to an increase in cash of $3,724,992, a decrease in contract assets and prepaid expense of $1,056,512 and a decrease in accounts receivable of $115,617. Current liabilities totaled $9,300,783 as of June 30, 2021 as compared to $8,912,247 as of June 30, 2020. The comparative increase in current liabilities is primarily attributable to an increase of $1,340,000 in our line of credit, $161,356 decrease comprised of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, offset by a decrease of $790,108 of current portion of the notes payable and extinguished debt . While no assurances can be given, management currently believes that the Company will continue to increase its cash flow from operations and working capital position in subsequent periods, and that it will have adequate cash resources to fund its operations and satisfy its debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. Contractual Obligations Total contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2021 are summarized in the following table: -21- Inflation The impact of inflation has historically not had a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results from operations; however, higher rates of inflation may cause retailers to slow their spending in the technology area, which could have an impact on the Company’s sales.","Park City Group, Inc. (“PCGI”)
The Company is a SaaS provider, and the parent company of ReposiTrak, a B2B e-commerce, compliance, and supply chain management platform company that partners with retailers, wholesalers, and product suppliers to help them source, vet, and transact with their suppliers in order to accelerate sales, control risks, and improve supply chain efficiencies.

The principal customers for the PCGI’s products are multi-store retail chains, wholesalers and distributors, and their suppliers. The Company derives revenue from five sources: (i) subscription fees, (ii) transaction based fees, (iii) professional services fees, (iv) license fees, and (v) hosting and maintenance fees. A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from its Supply Chain solutions and Compliance and Food Safety solutions in the form of recurring subscription payments from the suppliers. Revenue from the Company’s MarketPlace sourcing solution is transactional, based on the volume of products sourced via the application.

PCGI also provides professional consulting services targeting implementation, assessments, profit optimization and support functions for its applications and related products, for which revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion or pro rata basis over the life of the subscription, depending on the nature of the engagement.

In some instances, the Company will sell its software in the form of a license. Software maintenance agreements provide the customer with access to new software enhancements, maintenance releases, patches, updates and technical support personnel.

PCGI does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue and results of operation, liquidity or capital expenditures.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had revenue of $21,007,076 compared to $20,038,054 for the year ended June 30, 2020, a 5% increase. The increase in revenue was due to growth in both subscription revenue and Marketplace revenue.

"The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A. in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking 45 statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Our fiscal year ends on March 31. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Overview We offer the market-leading software intelligence platform, purpose-built for dynamic multicloud environments. As enterprises embrace the cloud to effect their digital transformation, our all-in-one intelligence platform is designed to address the growing complexity faced by technology and digital business teams. With automatic and intelligent observability, our all-in-one platform delivers precise answers about the performance and security of applications, the underlying infrastructure and the experience of all users to enable organizations to innovate faster, simplify cloud complexity, collaborate more efficiently, and secure cloud-native applications. We designed our software intelligence platform to allow our customers to modernize and automate IT operations, develop and release high quality software faster, and improve user experiences for consistently better business outcomes. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, our products are trusted by approximately 2,900 Dynatrace customers in 90 countries in diverse industries such as banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, travel and software. Since we began operations, we have been a leader within the application performance monitoring and observability spaces. In 2014, we leveraged the knowledge and experience of the same engineering team that founded Dynatrace to develop a new platform, the Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform, from the ground up with automation and intelligence at its core to address the complexity of modern, dynamic multiclouds and the applications that run on them. We market Dynatrace ® through a combination of our global direct sales team and a network of partners, including resellers, system integrators, and managed service providers. We target the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion. We generate revenue primarily by selling subscriptions, which we define as (i) Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) agreements, (ii) Dynatrace ® term-based licenses, for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term, (iii) Dynatrace ® perpetual licenses, which are recognized ratably over the term of the expected optional maintenance renewals, which is generally three years, and (iv) maintenance and support agreements. We deploy our platform as a SaaS solution, with the option of retaining the data in the cloud, or at the edge in customer-provisioned infrastructure, which we refer to as Dynatrace ® Managed. The Dynatrace ® Managed offering allows customers to maintain control of the environment where their data resides, whether in the cloud or on-premises, combining the simplicity of SaaS with the ability to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements. Our Mission Control functionality automatically upgrades all Dynatrace ® instances and offers on-premise cluster customers auto-deployment options that suit their specific enterprise management processes. Dynatrace ® is an all-in-one platform, which is typically purchased by our customers with the full-stack Application Performance Module and extended with our Infrastructure Monitoring, Digital Experience Monitoring, Digital Business Analytics, Application Security, or Cloud Automation Modules. Customers also have the option to purchase the infrastructure monitoring module where the full-stack APM is not required, with the ability to upgrade to the full-stack APM when necessary. Our Dynatrace ® platform has been commercially available since 2016 and is the primary offering we sell. Dynatrace ® customers increased to 2,936 as of March 31, 2021 from 2,373 as of March 31, 2020. Our Classic products include AppMon, Classic Real User Monitoring, or RUM, Network Application Monitoring, or NAM, and Synthetic Classic. As of April 2018, these products are only available to customers who had previously purchased them and were sunset as of April 1, 2021. Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot reliably predict. These factors may adversely impact business spending on technology as well as customers’ ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. While the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain, the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where we, our customers and partners conduct business. We may experience curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may be impacted by changes in our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; changes in the timing of our current or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers’ subscription contracts; or increased customer attrition rates. While our revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect, if any, of the COVID-19 pandemic would not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. 46 While the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we plan to continue to make investments to support business growth. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, develop new products and applications to extend the functionality of our products, and provide a high level of customer service. We expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to support customer growth. We also expect to continue to invest in research and development as we continue to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of our products. We also intend to maintain a high level of customer service and support which we consider critical for our continued success. We also expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support our business and to maintain the infrastructure required to be a public company. We intend to use our cash flow from operations to fund these growth strategies and support our business despite the potential impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. See the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to: • Extend our technology and market leadership position. We intend to maintain our position as the market-leading software intelligence platform through increased investment in research and development and continued innovation. We expect to focus on expanding the functionality of Dynatrace ® and investing in capabilities that address new market opportunities. We believe this strategy will enable new growth opportunities and allow us to continue to deliver differentiated high-value outcomes to our customers. • Grow our customer base. We intend to drive new customer growth by expanding our direct sales force focused on the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion. We added 584 new customers during the year ended March 31, 2021. In addition, we expect to leverage our global partner ecosystem to add new customers in geographies where we have direct coverage and work jointly with our partners. In other geographies, such as Africa, Japan, the Middle East, Russia and South Korea, we utilize a multi-tier “master reseller” model. • Increase penetration within existing customers. We plan to continue to increase penetration within our existing customers by expanding the breadth of our platform capabilities to provide for continued cross-selling opportunities. In addition, we believe the ease of implementation for Dynatrace ® provides us the opportunity to expand adoption within our existing enterprise customers, across new customer applications, and into additional business units or divisions. Our Dynatrace ® net expansion rate has been above 120% for the last twelve quarters. • Enhance our strategic partner ecosystem. Our strategic partners include industry-leading system integrators, software vendors, and cloud and technology providers. We intend to continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on expanding our strategic alliances and cloud-focused partnerships, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, and VMware Tanzu. Key Metrics In addition to our U.S. GAAP financial information, we monitor the following key metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations: Dynatrace ® Customers: We define the number of Dynatrace ® customers at the end of any reporting period as the number of accounts, as identified by a unique account identifier, that generate at least $10,000 of Dynatrace ® ARR as of the reporting date. In infrequent cases, a single large organization may comprise multiple customer accounts when there are distinct divisions, departments or subsidiaries that operate and make purchasing decisions independently from the parent organization. In cases where multiple customer accounts exist under a single organization, each customer account is counted separately based on a mutually exclusive accounting of ARR. As such, even though we target the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, there are more than 15,000 addressable Dynatrace ® customers. We believe that our ability to grow the number of Dynatrace ® customers is an indicator of our ability to drive market adoption of our platform, as well as our ability to grow the business and generate future subscription revenues. Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”): We define annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as the daily revenue of all subscription agreements that are actively generating revenue as of the last day of the reporting period multiplied by 365. We exclude from our calculation of ARR any revenues derived from month-to-month agreements and/or product usage overage billings, where customers 47 are billed in arrears based on product usage. Total ARR was $774 million as of March 31, 2021. Over the past year, Total ARR has grown by $201 million, or 35%. This growth was the result of a $62 million increase in ARR from new customer additions, a $128 million increase in ARR from the expansion of existing customers on the Dynatrace ® platform, and an $11 million increase in ARR as a result of expansion at the time of conversion from our Classic customers, net of churn. Dynatrace ® Net Expansion Rate: We define the Dynatrace ® net expansion rate as the Dynatrace ® ARR at the end of a reporting period for the cohort of Dynatrace ® accounts as of one year prior to the date of calculation, divided by the Dynatrace ® ARR one year prior to the date of calculation for that same cohort. Dynatrace ® net expansion rate has been above 120% for 12 consecutive quarters. Key Components of Results of Operations Revenue Revenue includes subscriptions, licenses and services. Subscription. Our subscription revenue consists of (i) SaaS agreements, (ii) Dynatrace ® term-based licenses which are recognized ratably over the contract term, (iii) Dynatrace ® perpetual licenses that are recognized ratably over the term of the expected optional maintenance renewals, which is generally three years, and (iv) maintenance and support agreements. We typically invoice SaaS subscription fees and term licenses annually in advance and recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Fees for our Dynatrace ® perpetual licenses are generally billed up front. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information. Over time, we expect subscription revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to focus on increasing subscription revenue as a key strategic priority. License. License revenue reflects the revenues recognized from sales of perpetual and term-based licenses of our Classic products that are sold only to existing customers. The license fee portion of Classic perpetual license arrangements is recognized upfront assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Classic term license fees are also recognized up front. Classic term licenses are generally billed annually in advance and perpetual licenses are billed up front. Service. Service revenue consists of revenue from helping our customers deploy our software in highly complex operational environments and train their personnel. We recognize the revenues associated with these professional services on a time and materials basis as we deliver the services or provide the training. We generally recognize the revenues associated with our services in the period the services are performed, provided that collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Cost of Revenue Cost of subscription . Cost of subscription revenue includes all direct costs to deliver and support our subscription products, including salaries, benefits, share-based compensation and related expenses such as employer taxes, allocated overhead for facilities, IT, third-party hosting fees related to our cloud services, and amortization of internally developed capitalized software technology. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. Cost of service . Cost of service revenue includes salaries, benefits, share-based compensation and related expenses such as employer taxes for our services organization, allocated overhead for depreciation of equipment, facilities and IT. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. Amortization of acquired technology . Amortization of acquired technology includes amortization expense for technology acquired in business combinations and the Thoma Bravo Funds’ acquisition of us in 2014. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our license, subscription, and services and other revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. Operating Expenses Personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. We also incur other non-personnel costs such as an allocation of our general overhead expenses. 48 Research and development . Research and development expenses primarily consists of the cost of programming personnel. We focus our research and development efforts on developing new solutions, core technologies, and to further enhance the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing solutions. We believe that our software development teams and our core technologies represent a significant competitive advantage for us and we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase, as we invest in research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our solutions. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consists of personnel and facility-related costs for our sales, marketing, and business development personnel, commissions earned by our sales personnel and the cost of marketing and business development programs. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and invest in marketing programs. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of the personnel and facility-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel; and other corporate expenses, including those associated with our ongoing public reporting obligations. We anticipate continuing to incur additional expenses due to growing our operations and being a public company, including higher legal, corporate insurance and accounting expenses. Amortization of other intangibles. Amortization of other intangibles primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships and capitalized software and tradenames. Restructuring and Other. Restructuring and other expenses primarily consists of various restructuring activities we have undertaken to achieve strategic and financial objectives. Restructuring activities include, but are not limited to, product offering cancellation and termination of related employees, office relocation, administrative cost of structure realignment and consolidation of resources. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency, including balances between subsidiaries. Interest expense, net of interest income, consists primarily of interest on our term loan facility, amortization of debt issuance costs, loss on debt extinguishment and prepayment penalties. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Our income tax (expense) benefit, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Our income tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory rate mainly due to (1) the impact of tax return to provision true-ups resulting from changes in estimates to the reorganization transaction tax and the corresponding impact to the uncertain tax positions, (2) differing tax rates and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, (3) differences in accounting and tax treatment of our share-based compensation, and (4) foreign withholding taxes. We expect this fluctuation in income tax rates, as well as its potential impact on our results of operations, to continue. Immaterial Revision of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we identified an immaterial error in the calculation of our income tax provision for the year ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the results for the year ended March 31, 2020 have been adjusted to incorporate the revised amounts, where applicable, as further described in Note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. 49 Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented: _________________ (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: 50 Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 Revenue Subscription Subscription revenue increased by $167.4 million, or 34%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the growing adoption of the Dynatrace ® platform by new customers combined with existing customers expanding their use of our solutions. Our subscription revenue increased to 93% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to 89% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020. License License revenue decreased by $11.2 million, or 89%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the decline of sales of our Classic products to existing customers as they convert to our Dynatrace ® platform. We are no longer selling our Classic products. Service Service revenue increased by $1.6 million, or 3%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. We generally recognize the revenues associated with professional services as we deliver the services. Cost of Revenue Cost of subscription Cost of subscription revenue increased by $4.3 million, or 6%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the growth of our subscription cloud-based offering of $9.7 million and cloud-based hosting costs and software subscriptions of $7.4 million. Partially offsetting this increase was lower share-based compensation of $8.3 million as well as decreases in costs for data centers closed during fiscal 2021. Cost of service Cost of service and other revenue decreased by $4.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of lower share-based compensation of $3.1 million and decreased travel costs of $2.1 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was increased personnel costs. Amortization of acquired technologies For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, amortization of acquired technologies is primarily related to amortization expense for technology acquired in connection with Thoma Bravo’s acquisition of us in 2014. 51 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Subscription Subscription gross profit increased by $163.1 million, or 39%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Subscription gross margin increased from 85% to 88% during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Dynatrace ® platform and lower share-based compensation. License License gross profit decreased by $11.2 million, or 89%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of a decline in sales of perpetual and term licenses for our Classic products. Service Service gross profit increased by $6.0 million, or 99%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Service gross margin increased from 13% to 26% during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Lower share-based compensation and travel costs increased gross profit by $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, compared to last fiscal year. Operating Expenses Research and development Research and development expenses decreased by $7.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower share-based compensation of $27.0 million, partially offset by a 24% increase in headcount and related allocated overhead, resulting in increased personnel and other costs to expand our product offerings of $15.3 million, and increased cloud-based hosting costs of $2.6 million. 52 Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $20.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower share-based compensation of $60.5 million and lower travel expenses of $11.1 million, partially offset by a 25% increase in headcount, resulting in an increase of $31.2 million in personnel costs, and increased advertising and marketing costs of $15.3 million. General and administrative General and administrative expenses decreased by $69.8 million, or 43%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation of $65.8 million and lower transaction costs of $18.3 million primarily related to the initial public offering completed in fiscal 2020. Partially offsetting this decrease was a 24% increase in headcount, resulting in an increase of $7.4 million in personnel costs, and increased professional fees of $3.5 million. Sponsor related costs were zero and $1.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Sponsor costs were reduced to zero as we stopped incurring these costs upon completion of our initial public offering. Amortization of other intangibles Amortization of other intangibles decreased by $5.5 million, or 14%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily the result of lower amortization for certain intangible assets that are amortized on a systematic basis that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are estimated to be realized and the completion of amortization on certain intangibles. Restructuring and other Restructuring expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 96%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, due to costs incurred in the prior fiscal year for various restructuring activities to achieve our strategic and financial objectives including costs related to a restructuring program designed to align employee resources with our product offering and future plans. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net decreased by $32.6 million, or 70%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in other expense was primarily a result of lower interest expense on our term loans as we had less principal outstanding compared to last fiscal year. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $193.1 million resulting in an expense of $2.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to an expense of $195.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the tax expense resulting from our reorganization transaction, net of attributes utilized, and related uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2020. Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 Revenue Subscription Subscription revenue increased by $138.0 million, or 39%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to the growing adoption of the Dynatrace ® platform by new customers combined with existing customers expanding their use of our solutions. Our subscription revenue increased to 89% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to 81% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2019. 53 License License revenue decreased by $27.7 million, or 69%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to decline of sales of our Classic products to existing customers as they convert to our Dynatrace ® platform. We are no longer selling our Classic products to new customers. Service Service revenue increased by $4.5 million, or 11%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. We recognize the revenues associated with professional services as we deliver the services. Cost of Revenue Cost of subscription Cost of subscription revenue increased by $16.3 million, or 29%, for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher share-based compensation of $9.0 million as well as higher personnel costs to support the growth of our subscription cloud-based offering. Cost of service Cost of service revenue increased by $7.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was the result of higher share-based compensation of $3.9 million as well as increased personnel costs to support the increase in use of our consulting and training services to support our new customers. Amortization of acquired technologies For the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, amortization of acquired technologies includes $16.2 million and $17.7 million, respectively, of amortization expense for technology acquired in connection with the Thoma Bravo Funds’ acquisition of us in 2014, with the remaining balance related primarily to the Qumram acquisition in November 2017. 54 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Subscription Subscription gross profit increased by $121.7 million, or 42%, during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. Subscription gross margin increased from 84% to 85%, during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. License License gross profit decreased by $27.7 million, or 69%, during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was the result of a decline in sales of perpetual and term licenses for our Classic products. Service Service gross profit decreased by $3.2 million, or 35%, during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. Service gross margin decreased from 23% to 13%, during the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. Higher share-based compensation costs decreased gross profit by $3.9 million compared to the last fiscal year. Operating Expenses Research and development Research and development expenses increased $42.5 million, or 55%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation of $26.1 million and a 20% increase in headcount and related allocated overhead, as well as other costs to expand our product offerings of $8.1 million. Higher software and maintenance expenses, primarily cloud-based hosting costs related to the development of our cloud-based offering of $3.8 million also contributed to the increase. 55 Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $87.3 million, or 49%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to higher share-based compensation of $60.0 million. Further contributing to the increase was a 14% increase in headcount, resulting in an increase of $23.1 million in personnel costs. General and administrative General and administrative expenses increased $70.2 million, or 76%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation of $52.3 million and higher transaction costs of $12.8 million related to the initial public offering completed in fiscal 2020. Further contributing to the increase was an increase in personnel costs and insurance costs. Sponsor related costs were $1.6 million and $4.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sponsor costs declined in 2020 because we stopped incurring these costs upon completion of our initial public offering. Amortization of other intangibles Amortization of other intangibles decreased by $7.4 million, or 16%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily the result of lower amortization for certain intangible assets that are amortized on a systematic basis that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are estimated to be realized and the completion of amortization on certain intangibles. Restructuring and other Restructuring expenses decreased by $0.7 million, or 38%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, due to lower costs incurred for various restructuring activities to achieve our strategic and financial objectives including costs related to a restructuring program designed to align employee resources with our product offering and future plans. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net decreased by $20.6 million, or 31%, for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in other expense was primarily a result of lower interest expense on our related party promissory notes as described further in Note 17 with the consolidated financial statements included herein. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Income tax expense increased by $219.0 million resulting in an expense of $195.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to an income tax benefit of $23.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to an increase in income tax expense as a result of our reorganization transactions during fiscal 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2021, we had $325.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $44.4 million available under our revolving credit facility. Since inception we have financed our operations primarily through payments by our customers for use of our product offerings and related services and, to a lesser extent, the net proceeds we have received from sales of equity securities and borrowings on our term loan facilities. In August 2019, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 38.9 million shares of common stock at a price of $16.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $585.3 million from the IPO, after underwriting discounts and commissions and payments of offering costs. Over the past three years, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company. Our historical expansion with customers has typically been achieved by executing additional contracts, each with unique pricing and anniversary dates. We are transitioning to a program that combines these contracts into one single, often multi-year contract per customer with one single anniversary date, which may result in variability in the timing and amounts of our billings which could impact the timing of our cash collections from period to period. 56 Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A. However, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment balances, funds available under our debt agreement, and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, seasonality of our billing activities, timing and extent of spending to support our growth strategy, and the continued market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Our Credit Facilities As of March 31, 2021, the balance outstanding under our first lien term loan was $401.1 million and is included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. We had $44.4 million available under the revolving credit facility after considering $15.6 million of letters of credit outstanding. All of our obligations under our term loans are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. At March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants pertaining to the First Lien Credit Agreement. Our credit facilities are discussed further in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Summary of Cash Flows _________________ (1) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities includes cash payments for interest and tax as follows: Operating Activities For the year ended March 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million as a result of net income of $75.7 million, and adjusted by non-cash charges of $113.6 million and a change of $31.2 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $61.0 million and share-based compensation of $57.8 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $96.5 million due to seasonality in our sales cycle, which is higher in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $26.6 million driven by the timing of payments, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.7 million driven by the timing of payments in advance of future services. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $82.0 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers and an increase in deferred commissions of $16.3 million due to commissions paid on new bookings. For the year ended March 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $142.5 million as a result of a net loss of $413.8 million, inclusive of a $255.8 million income tax payment related to the reorganization transactions, and adjusted by non-cash charges of $248.7 million and a change of $22.7 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of share-based compensation of $222.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $66.3 million, net of deferred income taxes of $46.2 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $91.4 million due to higher subscription sales and timing of amounts billed to customers compared to revenue recognized during the same period, which were partially offset by an increase in deferred commissions of $20.1 million due to commissions paid on new bookings. Further contributing to the change was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $57.6 million related to an 57 increase in income taxes refundable, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $53.0 million driven by our growth and the timing of payments, and an increase in accounts receivable of $44.0 million in line with higher sales and the timing of cash collections between the two periods. For the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $147.1 million as a result of a net loss of $116.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $115.9 million and a change of $147.4 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $80.1 million, share-based compensation of $71.2 million, and deferred income taxes of $34.2 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $127.0 million due to the timing of billings and cash received in advance of revenue recognition primarily for subscription and support services and a decrease in accounts receivable of $18.0 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers, partially offset by an increase in deferred commissions of $20.0 million, and an increase in prepayments and other assets of $12.4 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $13.9 million, as a result of the purchases of property and equipment of $14.1 million and capitalized software additions of $0.3 million, gross of $0.5 million of derecognized software costs. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2020 was $20.6 million, as a result of the purchases of property and equipment of $19.7 million and capitalized software additions of $0.9 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $9.3 million, as a result of purchases of property and equipment of $7.4 million and capitalized software additions of $1.9 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $97.8 million, primarily as a result of repayments of our term loans of $120.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of our stock options of $13.1 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of $9.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2020 was $329.4 million, primarily as a result of net proceeds from our initial public offering of $590.3 million and a contribution received for our tax obligation generated by our reorganization transactions of $265.0 million, which were partially offset by repayments on our term loans of $515.2 million, settlement of deferred offering costs of $5.0 million, and installments related to an acquisition of $4.7 million. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019 was $161.5 million, primarily as a result of payments to related parties of $1,177.0 million, repayments on our term loans of $83.9 million, debt issuance costs of $16.3 million and equity repurchases of $0.6 million, partially offset by $1,120.0 million in proceeds from term loans. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Under various agreements, we are obligated to make future cash payments. These include payments under our long-term debt agreements, rent payments required under operating lease agreements, interest obligations on our term loans, and other contractual commitments. 58 The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021: ________________ (1) The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (2) Amounts represent estimated future interest payments on borrowings under our First Lien Term Loan, which were estimated using the interest rate effective at March 31, 2021 multiplied by the principal outstanding on March 31, 2021. The First Lien Term Loan consists of $401.1 million currently bearing interest at 2.4%. (3) As of March 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $15.6 million of letters of credit outstanding, and $44.4 million was available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2021, we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These accrued liabilities are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be repaid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation, income taxes, goodwill, and impairment of long-lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from contracts with customers using the five-step method described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. At contract inception we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We combine contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer if (i) we determine that the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, (ii) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract, or (iii) the services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation. The identification of our performance obligations involves review and consideration for the contractual terms, the implied rights of our customers, if any, product demonstrations and published website and marketing materials. Our performance obligations consist of (i) subscription and support services, (ii) licenses for our Classic products, and (iii) professional and other services. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price. We determine standalone selling price, or SSP, for all our performance obligations using observable inputs, such as standalone sales and historical contract pricing. SSP is consistent with our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of subscription services and professional and other services. SSP also reflects the amount we would charge for that performance obligation if it were sold separately in a standalone sale, and the price we would sell to similar customers in similar circumstances. We have determined that our pricing for software licenses and subscription services is highly variable and we therefore allocate the transaction price to those performance obligations using the residual approach. 59 In general, we satisfy the majority of our performance obligations over time as we transfer the promised services to our customers. We review the contract terms and conditions to evaluate (i) the timing and amount of revenue recognition, (ii) the related contract balances, and (iii) our remaining performance obligations. We also estimate the number of hours expected to be incurred based on an expected hours approach that considers historical hours incurred for similar projects based on the types and sizes of customers. These evaluations require significant judgment that could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized. Share-based Compensation We historically issued Management Incentive Units (“MIUs”) and Appreciation Units (“AUs”) under the Management Incentive Unit Plan, or the MIU Plan. Following the IPO, we ceased granting awards under the MIU Plan, and all outstanding awards were converted into shares of common stock, restricted stock, and restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan. Under the 2019 Plan, we have granted stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units to certain key employees and non-employee directors. For further information see Note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Compensation expense relating to share-based payments is recognized in earnings using a fair-value measurement method. We use the straight-line attribution method of recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period in which the awards are forfeited. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the MIUs and AUs were estimated on the date of grant using the option-pricing model, or OPM, or a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method and the option-pricing model, which we referred to as the hybrid method. Use of the OPM model and hybrid method required that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our equity awards, the expected term to expiration or a liquidity event, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our equity awards. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We used the simplified method prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of units granted to employees and directors. We based the expected term of options granted to non-employees on the contractual term of the units. We determined the risk-free interest rate by reference to the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect as of the valuation date with the maturity matching the expected term. The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the MIUs and AUs during the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: Subsequent to our IPO, the fair value of each new equity award and purchase right under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of each option award and purchase right using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our stock options and purchase rights under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, the expected term to expiration or a liquidity event, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and purchase rights under the ESPP. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies. We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The computation of expected term for the stock options is based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding, generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options’ remaining vesting term and contractual expiration period, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The computation of expected term for the purchase rights under the ESPP is based on the offering period, which is six months. We determined the risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected life of the award. We use a dividend yield of zero, as we do not currently issue dividends, nor do we expect to do so in the future. 60 The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights granted during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. We have the ability to permanently reinvest any earnings in our foreign subsidiaries and therefore do not record a deferred tax liability on any outside basis differences in our investments in subsidiaries. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that these assets will more likely than not be realized. These deferred tax assets are subject to periodic assessments as to recoverability, and if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized, valuation allowances are recorded which would reduce deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We account for uncertain tax positions based on those positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We determine if the amount of available support indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. We then measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions are included in the income tax provision. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identified net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually, as of January 1, or more often if and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. 61 We use our internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including amortized intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and other market-related valuation models, including earnings multiples and comparable asset market values. If circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value, then we will compare the estimated fair value of long-lived assets (including goodwill) to its book value. If the book value exceeds the estimated fair value, we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We did not incur any impairment losses during the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

As enterprises embrace the cloud to effect their digital transformation, the company’s all-in-one intelligence platform is designed to address the growing complexity faced by technology and digital business teams. With automatic and intelligent observability, the company’s all-in-one platform delivers precise answers about the performance and security of applications, the underlying infrastructure and the experience of all users to enable organizations to innovate faster, simplify cloud complexity, collaborate more efficiently, and secure cloud-native applications. The company designed its software intelligence platform to allow its customers to modernize and automate IT operations, develop and release high quality software faster, and improve user experiences for consistently better business outcomes. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, the company’s products are trusted by approximately 2,900 Dynatrace customers in 90 countries in diverse industries such as banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, travel and software.
Since the company began operations, it has been a leader within the application performance monitoring and observability spaces. In 2014, the company leveraged the knowledge and experience of the same engineering team that founded Dynatrace to develop a new platform, the Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform, from the ground up with automation and intelligence at its core to address the complexity of modern, dynamic multiclouds and the applications that run on them.
The company markets Dynatrace® through a combination of its global direct sales team and a network of partners, including resellers, system integrators, and managed service providers. The company targets the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion.
The company generates revenue primarily by selling subscriptions, which it define as (i) Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) agreements, (ii) Dynatrace® term-based licenses, for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term, (iii) Dynatrace® perpetual licenses, which are recognized ratably over the term of the expected optional maintenance renewals, which is generally three years, and (iv) maintenance and support agreements.
Subscription revenue increased by $167.4 million, or 34%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the growing adoption of the Dynatrace® platform by new customers combined with existing customers expanding their use of the company’s solutions. The company’s subscription revenue increased to 93% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to 89% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020. License revenue decreased by $11.2 million, or 89%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the decline of sales of the company’s Classic products to existing customers as they convert to the company’s Dynatrace® platform. The company is no longer selling its Classic products. Service revenue increased by $1.6 million, or 3%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020.
Cost of subscription revenue increased by $4.3 million, or 6%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the growth of the company’s subscription cloud-based offering of $9.7 million and cloud-based hosting costs and software subscriptions of $7.4 million. Partially offsetting this increase was lower share-based compensation of $8.3 million as well as decreases in costs for data centers closed during fiscal 2021. Cost of service and other revenue decreased by $4.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of lower share-based compensation of $3.1 million and decreased travel costs of $2.1 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was increased personnel costs.
Subscription gross profit increased by $163.1 million, or 39%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Subscription gross margin increased from 85% to 88% during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Dynatrace® platform and lower share-based compensation. License gross profit decreased by $11.2 million, or 89%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of a decline in sales of perpetual and term licenses for the company’s Classic products. Service gross profit increased by $6.0 million, or 99%, during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Service gross margin increased from 13% to 26% during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. Lower share-based compensation and travel costs increased gross profit by $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, compared to last fiscal year.
As of March 31, 2021, the company had $325.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $44.4 million available under its revolving credit facility. Since inception the company has financed its operations primarily through payments by its customers for use of its product offerings and related services and, to a lesser extent, the net proceeds the company has received from sales of equity securities and borrowings on the company’s term loan facilities. In August 2019, the company completed its IPO in which it issued and sold an aggregate of 38.9 million shares of common stock at a price of $16.00 per share. The company received aggregate net proceeds of $585.3 million from the IPO, after underwriting discounts and commissions and payments of offering costs.
Over the past three years, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as the company has invested in growing its business.
As of March 31, 2021, the balance outstanding under the company’s first lien term loan was $401.1 million and is included in long-term debt on consolidated balance sheets. The company had $44.4 million available under the revolving credit facility after considering $15.6 million of letters of credit outstanding.
For the year ended March 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million as a result of net income of $75.7 million, and adjusted by non-cash charges of $113.6 million and a change of $31.2 million in the company’s operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $61.0 million and share-based compensation of $57.8 million. The change in the company’s net operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $96.5 million due to seasonality in the company’s sales cycle, which is higher in the third and fourth quarters of the company’s fiscal year, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $26.6 million driven by the timing of payments, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.7 million driven by the timing of payments in advance of future services. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $82.0 million due to the timing of receipts of payments from customers and an increase in deferred commissions of $16.3 million due to commissions paid on new bookings.
For the year ended March 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $142.5 million as a result of a net loss of $413.8 million, inclusive of a $255.8 million income tax payment related to the reorganization transactions, and adjusted by non-cash charges of $248.7 million and a change of $22.7 million in the company’s operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of share-based compensation of $222.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $66.3 million, net of deferred income taxes of $46.2 million. The change in the company’s net operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $91.4 million due to higher subscription sales and timing of amounts billed to customers compared to revenue recognized during the same period, which were partially offset by an increase in deferred commissions of $20.1 million due to commissions paid on new bookings. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $13.9 million, as a result of the purchases of property and equipment of $14.1 million and capitalized software additions of $0.3 million, gross of $0.5 million of derecognized software costs. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021 was $97.8 million, primarily as a result of repayments of the company’s term loans of $120.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of the company’s stock options of $13.1 million and proceeds from the company’s employee stock purchase plan of $9.2 million.
