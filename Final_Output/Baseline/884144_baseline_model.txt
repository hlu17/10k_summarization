Revenues: revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. revenue mix varies by product. excluding revenue from discontinued operations, our total revenue in 2020 was $65,507 as compared to $73,150 in 2019. total revenue decreased by $(7,643), or (10.4)%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. recurring revenue comprised the majority of the decrease. hardware and professional services revenue trended downward, partially offset by an increase in on premise software license revenue. Although our total customer base is widely spread across industries, our hcm sales are concentrated in small to mid-size businesses.

Interest Expense: interest expense and other, net was $(2,221) for the year ended 2020 as compared to $(16,005) in theyear ended 2019. Interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense on notes payable. The Company has no plans to sell any of its non-core assets.

Liquidity: We expect that deferred revenue will convert to future revenue as we perform our services, but this does not represent future payments. as of december 31, 2020, asure’s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately $28,577 of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations of our business over the next twelve months, and $4,500 available for borrowing under our wells fargo revolver. We believe the available sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund such growth activities but may raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement those sources as we execute on our growth plan. We were not in compliance with our minimum ebitda financial covenant as of march 31, 2020. In december 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering 2,990,000 shares of our common stock. if we do not receive forgiveness of our entire loan, we will be obligated to begin repaying the portion of the principal and interest that is not forgiven such that it is fully paid no later than april 15, 2022, unless we are able to negotiate new payment terms with pinnacle bank. we expect that payments we may owe, if any, would not start until second quarter of 2021. see note 6 - notes payable in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information about the credit agreement.
