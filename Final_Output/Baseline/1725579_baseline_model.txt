We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.

Revenues: we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized ratably as revenue over the subscription period. subscriptions that allow the customer to take software on-premise without significant penalty are recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customers. we also derive Revenue from providing professional services, which generally consist of consulting, integration, or other services.

Gross Profit Margin: Cost of revenue includes certain direct costs associated with delivering our platform and includes costs for author and instructor fees, amortization of our content library and other acquired intangibles. gross profit was $309.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $245.6 million in 2019, an increase of $63.8 million. We expect our gross margin to increase over the long term primarily due to a decrease in author fees.

Operating Income: our operating expenses are classified as sales and marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative. for each of these categories, the largest component is employee-related costs, which include salaries and bonuses, equity-based compensation expense,. and employee benefit costs. we allocate shared overhead costs such as information technology infrastructure and facility- related costs based on headcount in each category. the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $62.2 million.
