Business Overview
The text discusses the accounting practices of the company related to acquisitions and revenue recognition. When acquiring a company, the assets and liabilities are recognized at their fair value, and any excess is recorded as goodwill. However, estimates and assumptions made during this process are subject to refinement, and adjustments may be made during a measurement period of up to one year. The company also makes significant estimates and assumptions for intangible assets, contractual obligations, and contingencies. Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, and the company evaluates whether products or services are distinct before accounting for them as separate performance obligations. Revenue from on-premises software and software-as-a-service subscriptions, professional services, and scoring services are recognized differently. The company is subject to various legal proceedings and assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes and potential losses, which are subject to adjustment based on new developments or revised strategies. The estimates and assumptions made by the company are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of acquired companies and are subject to uncertainties, which could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations. However, the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of material changes in future estimates.

Results of Operations
The company is divided into two reportable segments: software and scores. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the company modified its operating segments to better align with how its chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. The company also changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services, and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services, and scores. The company's contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services, and determining whether products and services are considered distinct and should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. Significant judgment may also be required to determine the timing of satisfaction of a performance obligation in certain professional services contracts with a fixed consideration.

Revenues
The text provides summary information on the revenues of the company for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The company recognizes a significant portion of revenue from on-premises software subscriptions at the point in time when the software is first made available to the customer or at the beginning of the subscription term, despite the fact that contracts typically call for billing these amounts ratably over the life of the subscription. This creates significant variability in the revenue recognized period to period based on the timing of the subscription start date and the subscription term. The company uses annualized revenue run rate (ARR) to measure the underlying performance of its subscription-based contracts and mitigate the impact of this variability. The company's total GAAP revenue was $1.32 billion during fiscal year 2021, a 2% increase from fiscal year 2020. The total revenue for the scores segment was $654.1 million during fiscal year 2021, a 24% increase from fiscal year 2020. The annual recurring revenue for the software segment as of September 30, 2021, was $524.0 million, a 6% increase from September 30, 2020, excluding divestitures. The dollar-based net retention rate for the software segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 106%, excluding divestitures. The cash and cash equivalents were $195.4 million as of September 30, 2021, compared with $157.4 million as of September 30, 2020. The operating income was $505.5 million during fiscal year 2021, a 71% increase from fiscal 2020. The net income was $392.1 million during fiscal year 2021, a 66% increase from fiscal 2020. The cash flow from operations was $423.8 during fiscal year 2021, compared with $364.9 million generated during the prior year. The total debt balance was $1.268 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared with $845 million as of September 30, 2020. The company spent $882.2 million on share repurchases, compared with $235.2 million spent during the prior year.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenues for a software company primarily includes employee salaries, benefits, and incentives, as well as overhead costs, data center costs, software royalty fees, third-party hosting fees, credit bureau data and processing services, travel costs, and outside services. In fiscal year 2021, the cost of revenues decreased by $28.7 million compared to 2020, due to a decrease in personnel and labor costs, allocated facilities and infrastructure costs, and travel costs, partially offset by an increase in direct materials costs. These decreases were mainly due to a strategic cost initiative that involved reducing the workforce, consolidating office space, and abandoning certain property and equipment. The decrease in travel costs was also due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in direct materials costs was primarily due to increased third-party data costs related to increased scores revenue. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 25% in 2021 from 28% in 2020, mainly due to increased sales of higher-margin scores products. In fiscal year 2020, the cost of revenues increased by $24.3 million compared to 2019, mainly due to an increase in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs, personnel and labor costs, and direct materials cost, partially offset by a decrease in travel costs. The increase in facilities and infrastructure costs was due to expansion in cloud infrastructure operations, while the increase in personnel and labor costs was due to an increase in the company's average headcount. The increase in direct materials costs was due to an increase in license and scores revenues that incur third-party royalties and data costs. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 28% in 2020, which was consistent with that incurred during 2019.

Operating Income
The text provides summary information on operating income for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021 on a segment basis. In fiscal 2021, there was an increase in operating income of $209.5 million, primarily due to gains on product line asset sales and business divestiture, decreased operating expenses, decreased restructuring and impairment charges, increased segment revenue, and decreased corporate expenses, partially offset by increased share-based compensation expense. The increase in segment operating income was due to an increase in the Scores segment operating income and decreased software segment operating income. In fiscal 2020, the increase in operating income was due to increased segment revenues and decreased amortization expense, partially offset by increased restructuring and impairment charges, increased segment operating expenses, and increased share-based compensation expense. The increase in segment operating income was due to increased Scores and software segment operating income. Overall, the Scores segment had an 86% segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue, consistent with fiscal 2019 and 2020, while the software segment had a 16-17% segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue, consistent with fiscal 2019 and 2020.

Interest Expense
The text explains that interest expense for the company primarily consists of interest on senior notes issued in December 2019, May 2018, and July 2010 (which were paid in full in July 2020), as well as interest and credit facility fees on a revolving line of credit. Interest income is also included on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and is derived from investing excess funds. The decrease in net interest expense of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020 was due to a lower average outstanding debt balance, while the increase in net interest expense of $2.4 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a higher average outstanding debt balance.

Liquidity
The company's primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. In fiscal year 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $423.8 million, an increase of $58.9 million from the previous year. This increase was primarily due to a $155.7 million increase in net income and a $28.6 million increase from timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by a $125.4 million decrease in non-cash items, including a $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales and a business divestiture. 

In fiscal year 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $364.9 million, an increase of $104.5 million from the previous year. This increase was primarily due to a $44.3 million increase in net income, a $46.1 million increase in non-cash items, including a $28.0 million increase in impairment loss on operating lease assets, and a $14.2 million increase from timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $137.9 million in fiscal year 2021, a change of $162.5 million from the previous year. This change was primarily due to $147.4 million in cash proceeds from product line asset sales and a business divestiture, and a $14.4 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $523.6 million in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $234.2 million from the previous year. This increase was primarily due to a $639.0 million increase in repurchases of common stock and a $350.0 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of senior notes, partially offset by a $419.0 million increase in proceeds from our revolving line of credit, a $254.0 million decrease in payments on our revolving line of credit, and an $85.0 million decrease in payments on senior notes. 

In fiscal year 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $289.4 million, an increase of $89.4 million from the previous year. This increase was primarily due to a $338.0 million increase in payments, net of proceeds, on our revolving line of credit and a $49.9 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by a $293.0 million increase in proceeds, net of payments, from our senior notes.

Debt
The table presented in the text summarizes the contractual obligations of the company as of September 30, 2021, including unpaid principal amount and interest payments on senior notes, and unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. The company had issued $400 million of senior notes in 2018 and $350 million in 2019, with semi-annual interest payments and maturity dates in 2026 and 2028, respectively. The company is in compliance with all financial covenants under these obligations and does not believe it is at material risk of not meeting these covenants due to COVID-19. The company also amended its credit agreement in August 2021, increasing its borrowing capacity to $600 million and extending its maturity to 2026. It had $518.0 million in borrowings outstanding with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.212% and was in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility. In October 2021, the company entered into an amendment to its credit agreement to provide for an unsecured term loan of $300 million, subject to the same pricing and covenants as the revolving line of credit, with consecutive quarterly installments commencing March 31, 2022.
