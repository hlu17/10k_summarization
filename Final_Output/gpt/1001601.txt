Business Overview
MGT Capital Investments has consolidated its bitcoin mining operations into a company-owned facility in Lafayette, Georgia, which has access to over 20 MW of low-cost power. The facility houses approximately 649 Antminer S17 Pro bitcoin miners, rated at approximately 30 PH/s in computing power, but about half of them are in need of repair or replacement due to manufacturing defects. The company is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations, including equipment sales, leasing space to other bitcoin miners and raising capital to acquire the latest generation miners. Prior to establishing its company-owned facility, MGT conducted its bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements and management agreements with third-party investors, which have since been terminated.

Results of Operations
In 2020, the revenues of a cryptocurrency mining company increased by 220% to $1,440, primarily due to increased production and prices of bitcoin. The company also received royalties from the sale of pod5 mining containers, but the revenue from it decreased to $4 in 2020 from $44 in 2019. Operating expenses decreased by 46% to $4,311, majorly due to lower general and administrative expenses. However, the cost of revenue increased by 239% to $1,728, primarily due to higher electricity usage and depreciation expenses. The general and administrative expenses decreased by 65% to $2,584, mainly due to lower stock-based compensation, payroll and related expenses, consulting fees, and legal and professional fees. The non-operating expenses in 2020 consisted of accretion of debt discount, a loss on sale of property and equipment, and interest expenses, partially offset by the change in fair value of the liability associated with the termination of management agreements, the change in fair value of derivative liability, funding from the PPP loan, and other income.

Liquidity
The company has historically financed its business through the sale of debt and equity interests, but has incurred significant operating losses since inception and continues to generate losses. As of December 31, 2020, the company had a working capital deficit and will need to raise additional funding to grow its operations and pay current maturities of debt. The price of bitcoin is volatile and fluctuations have had a negative impact on the company's operating results and liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic presents potential impacts on the company's operations in different global geographies, but to date travel restrictions have not materially impacted its ability to operate. The company has taken actions to reduce its administrative and advisory costs required as a publicly reporting company, including salary reductions for senior management and termination of certain consulting agreements. The primary source of operating funds has been through debt and equity financing. MGT Capital Investments, Inc. has provided an update on its various financial activities in its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The document reveals that the company has issued a convertible promissory note worth $13,210 to Bucktown Capital, and it will mature in 12 months. The note will be funded in tranches, with the initial tranche of $1,210 funded by the investor on March 5, 2021, for consideration of $1,000. Six subsequent tranches (five tranches, each for $1,200 and one tranche for $6,000) will be funded upon the notice of effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the common stock issuable in connection with the 2021 note. Until such time as the investor has funded the subsequent tranches, the company will hold a series of investor notes that offset any unfunded portion of the 2021 note. The company has also received notice of forgiveness in the amount of $108 in relation to the PPP loan.
