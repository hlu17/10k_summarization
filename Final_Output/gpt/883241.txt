Business Overview
Synopsys, Inc. is a global leader in supplying electronic design automation (EDA) software used to design and test integrated circuits (ICs) and semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, as well as software tools and services that improve the security, quality, and compliance of software in various industries. The company's revenue growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on its leadership in EDA products, expanding and proliferating its IP offerings, driving growth in the software security and quality market, and continuing to expand its product portfolio and total addressable market. The company's consolidated financial statements and notes to the statements should be considered for a more complete discussion on its financial condition and operations. The company's revenue growth may vary from period to period based on the mix of its time-based and upfront products.

Results of Operations
Synopsys, a software company, has reported an increase in revenue of $518.9m or 14% for fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher revenue resulting from growth across all products and geographies. Its operating income also grew by $114.6m or 18% as revenue growth exceeded costs and expenses. However, the company warns that the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and net income are based on assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can affect their accuracy. The accounting policies that most frequently require assumptions, judgments, and estimates are revenue recognition, valuation of business combinations, and income taxes. The company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 6.1%, which included a tax benefit of $45.5m of the US federal research tax credit, a foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction of $31.2m, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $94.0m. Synopsys also faces an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court over a tax dispute with the Hungarian tax authority, which resulted in a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4m.

Revenues
The company generates revenue from two business segments: the semiconductor & system design segment and the software integrity segment. The semiconductor & system design segment includes EDA software, IP & system integration, hardware products, and professional service contracts. Revenue is recognized over time for professional service contracts and hardware maintenance obligations, while revenue for IP licenses is recognized at a point in time. The software integrity segment sells software licenses, maintenance updates, and technical support as a combined performance obligation. Revenue for this segment is recognized over the term of the arrangement. Revenue is subject to fluctuations based on customer requirements, and the increase in revenue for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to organic growth and increased investments by customers in new, complex designs for hardware and software products. Customers negotiate with the company over many aspects of their arrangements, including expanded license usage and future purchase rights.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenue for a company is divided into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. Consulting and training services are segregated from cost of products revenue. Group costs are allocated based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and licensed, hardware-related direct costs, product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver maintenance and consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services, and documentation of maintenance updates. Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of core/developed technology and certain contract rights intangible. The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, hardware related costs, and higher deferred compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in depreciation and maintenance expense, servicing IP consulting arrangements expense, and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in other cost of revenue categories were not individually material.

Interest Expense
The increase in other income (expense) for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was mainly due to an increase in the fair value of the company's executive deferred compensation plan assets.

Liquidity
The primary sources of liquidity for the company are generated from their business operations and from funds that can be drawn down under the revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2021, the company held $1,580.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, with cash equivalents consisting mainly of taxable money market mutual funds, time deposits, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. The short-term investments include US government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt, and asset-backed securities. The company believes that the overall credit quality of their portfolio is strong, with their global excess cash and cash equivalents invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. As of October 31, 2021, approximately $799.1 million of their cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. The company believes that their existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy their cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The company's future cash requirements will depend on various factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the expansion of their sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of their spending to support their research and development efforts. The company may also invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications, or technologies, or further expand their board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.

Debt
The company has operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment, and other assets, with lease payment obligations of $588.3 million, net of immaterial sublease income, as of October 31, 2021, and $80.4 million payable within 12 months. The company also has purchase obligations of $301.7 million, with $151.8 million payable within 12 months, representing all open purchase orders and contractual obligations for which goods or services have not been received. The terms of open purchase orders allow the company to cancel, reschedule, and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to delivery or performance. The company has $27.9 million of long-term accrued income taxes, representing uncertain tax benefits. The company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $650.0 million and a senior unsecured term loan facility of $150.0 million, with $75.0 million outstanding under the term loan as of October 31, 2021. The credit agreement was amended in January 2021 to extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility to January 22, 2024, with an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $150.0 million. The company also has a credit agreement with a lender in China for a 12-year 220.0 million RMB credit to support facilities expansion, with $25.1 million outstanding as of October 31, 2021, and the remaining balance was repaid in full on November 26, 2021.
