Results of Operations
Mitek Systems has reported that certain amounts included in its preliminary unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations differ from those reported in its earnings release dated November 4, 2021. The differences are due to an increase in acquisition-related costs and expenses of $0.4m due to the revaluation of its acquisition-related contingent consideration liability that was recorded as part of the ID R&amp;D acquisition. Despite the revisions, the company believes that the amounts are not materially different from those reported in the earnings release. Mitek Systems uses specific methods, inputs, and assumptions to determine amounts of revenue to recognize, including identifying distinct performance obligations and allocating transaction prices between separate goods and services in a multi-element arrangement.

Revenues
The table presented in the text compares the results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, with the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. The total revenue increased 18% to $119.8 million in 2021, compared to $101.3 million in 2020, with software and hardware revenue increasing by 11% to $60.1 million in 2021. The services and other revenue increased by 27% to $59.7 million in 2021, mainly due to growth in mobile verify transactional SaaS revenue. The cost of revenue increased by 10% to $14.5 million in 2021, primarily because of an increase in variable personnel, hosting, and royalty costs. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 18% to $32.5 million in 2021, mainly due to higher personnel-related costs and product promotion costs. Research and development expenses increased by 23% to $28.0 million in 2021, mainly due to higher personnel-related costs and third-party contractor expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 1% to $22.5 million in 2021. Acquisition-related costs and expenses increased by 36% to $9.0 million in 2021. There were no restructuring costs in 2021. The income tax provision for 2021 was $0.8 million.

Liquidity
The company had $227.4 million in cash and investments as of September 30, 2021, compared to $62.0 million the previous year, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of 2026 notes, net cash from operations, and equity plan common stock issuance. The company also made payments for acquisition-related expenses, capital expenditures, and other costs. Net cash from operating activities was $37.3 million, primarily from net income, non-cash charges, and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. The company's net cash used in investing activities was $170.5 million, which included net purchases of investments, cash paid for acquisition, and capital expenditures. The net cash provided by financing activities was $143.7 million, mainly from the issuance of 2026 notes and equity plan common stock, partially offset by call spreads on the sales and purchases of warrants and convertible senior notes hedge. The company issued $155.3 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2026, which are convertible at the holder's option and will mature on February 1, 2026, and the net proceeds were approximately $149.7 million. The company also entered into transactions for convertible notes hedge and warrants related to the issuance of the 2026 notes. The company acquired up to 7.4 million shares of its common stock through warrant transactions, which will expire during the 80 trading days commencing on and including May 1, 2026. The transactions may be settled in net shares of common stock or net cash at the company’s election, and the company received $23.9 million in cash proceeds. However, the transactions may result in incremental dilution of earnings per share if the average share price exceeds $26.53 for any fiscal quarter. The company also entered into a section 382 rights agreement, which expired on October 22, 2021, and issued a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock. The company's board authorized a share repurchase program for up to $15 million of the currently outstanding shares of its common stock, which will expire on June 30, 2022. The company made purchases of $0.2 million during fiscal 2021 and $8.1 million from October 1, 2021, through December 10, 2021, under the program. The company had investments of $197.1 million designated as available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2021, and working capital of $164.8 million at the same date. The company believes its current cash balance and cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy its working capital needs for the next twelve months.

Debt
As of September 30, 2021, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. In February 2021, the company issued $155.3 million worth of convertible notes due in 2026 and entered into privately-negotiated convertible senior note hedge and warrant transactions to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the notes. The company was unable to issue shares of its common stock upon settlement of the notes due to insufficient authorized share capital, so the embedded conversion option was accounted for as a derivative liability and the notes hedge as a derivative asset. The resulting gain or loss was reported in other income, net. The warrant transactions were recorded in additional paid-in-capital and are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet conditions for equity classification. Additional information related to these transactions can be found in Note 8 of the company's financial statements.
