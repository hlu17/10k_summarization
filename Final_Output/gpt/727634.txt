Business Overview
iSign Solutions is a leading supplier of document transaction management software designed for paperless, secure, and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. Its products and services provide legally binding transactions that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, resulting in a higher level of security than paper-based processes. The company's solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management, and various options for biometric authentication, available across virtually all enterprise, desktop, and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. The company has been a leading supplier of enterprise software solutions within the financial services and insurance industries, enabling a completely electronic document and workflow process and a significant reduction in mailing, scanning, filing, and other costs related to the use of paper. However, the company has incurred losses every year since its inception, and its accumulated deficit is approximately $135,350 as of December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted supply chains and affected production and sales across a wide range of industries, and the extent of its impact on iSign's operational and financial performance is uncertain. For the year ended December 31, 2020, iSign's total revenue was $966, an increase of $122 compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to the company's growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services. Its loss from operations decreased by $130, or 17%, compared to the prior year, and the company received loan proceeds of approximately $123 under the Paycheck Protection Program to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The company's critical accounting policies include stock-based compensation, valuation of equity warrants, derivatives, and revenue recognition. The text describes the five steps to be followed for revenue recognition and contract accounting. The first step is to identify the contract(s) with a customer, followed by identifying the performance obligations in the contract. The next step is to determine the transaction price for each performance obligation, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation. The performance obligations are promises that are distinct, and the transaction price is the amount of consideration a company expects to receive from a customer in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to all separate performance obligations within the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. The company recognizes revenue when it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to the customer. The company may exercise significant judgment while determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. The text also describes practical expedients and exemptions, such as expensing the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less. The text also describes the factors considered while estimating future cash flows from the products, such as customer base, cost of sales, and research and development costs. The text also discusses segments and revision to financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase in product revenue is mainly due to the increase in engineering service revenue, while the increase in maintenance revenue is due to existing customers renewing maintenance contracts at higher price points.

Gross Profit Margin
In 2020, the cost of sales increased by 21% compared to the previous year, primarily due to higher direct engineering costs associated with the mix of engineering service and software product revenue. The cost of sales for 2020 was $146, up from $121 in the prior year.

Operating Income
The research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $578, which is an 8% decrease compared to the prior year.
