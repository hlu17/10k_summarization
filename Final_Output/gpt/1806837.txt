Business Overview
The company historically signs a higher percentage of software subscription agreements with new and existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year, due to typical buying patterns in the software industry. This seasonality is reflected in revenues and commission expenses. The company's revenue growth has not been consistent, as enterprise and large corporations' purchase patterns can be sensitive to timing of budget decisions. Operating expenses have increased due to headcount and related expenses to support the company's growth. The company expects to continue expanding its operations and headcount, which may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability. The company has an extensive network of partners and plans to invest in further enhancing its software, including through acquisitions or development arrangements with partners. The company expects a continued shift to its cloud solutions from existing and newly acquired customers, which could increase revenue growth rate but may also decrease gross margin due to associated hosting costs.

Results of Operations
The financial results presented in the annual report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results, especially as the company converted to a C-corporation which will result in taxation at the corporate level. Revenues increased to $374.7 million in 2020, a 16.5% increase from 2019, driven by an increase in software subscription revenues of $41.1 million and a $12.0 million increase in services revenues. Cost of software subscriptions revenues increased to 28.2% in 2020, up from 24.0% in 2019, and cost of services revenues rose to 15.9% in 2020, up from 10.3% in 2019. Research and development expenses increased to 14.5% in 2020, up from 9.5% in 2019, and selling and marketing expenses increased to 26.5% in 2020, up from 21.2% in 2019. General and administrative expenses increased to 39.8% in 2020, up from 22.1% in 2019. Interest expense increased to $3.1 million in 2020, up from $1.0 million in 2019, primarily due to the write-down of deferred financing fees of $1.4 million. The income tax benefit increased to $28.9 million in 2020, up from $0.2 million in 2019, due to the establishment of deferred tax assets at the higher C-corporation tax rate.

Revenues
The company generates revenue from software subscriptions and services, recognizing revenue upon transfer of control of products and services to customers. Contracts may include various combinations of products and services that can be accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of cancellations and taxes collected from customers. On-premise software subscriptions provide customers with a right to use the software as it exists when made available, with revenue recognized ratably over the license term. Cloud-based subscriptions allow customers to use company-hosted software, with revenue recognized ratably over the subscription period. The company also generates revenue through software subscription-related services and managed services offerings. Revenue increased in 2019 due to growth in software subscriptions and services revenue. Cost of software subscriptions and services revenue increased due to personnel costs and infrastructure investments to support growth. The company plans to invest in new innovations and offerings, sales and marketing teams, and solution development to address increased demand. The majority of revenue comes from recurring software subscriptions, and the company uses annual recurring revenue (ARR) and net revenue retention rate (NRR) as key metrics. ARR increased in 2020 due to growth in revenues from existing and new customers. NRR decreased in 2020 due to delays in signing deals and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company plans to continue investing in growth.

Gross Profit Margin
The text outlines the costs associated with providing and supporting software subscriptions, including personnel expenses such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as direct costs related to information technology and tax content maintenance. These costs also include amortization of expenses for internal-use software, developed software for new products, and cloud-based subscription solutions, as well as the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company plans to continue expanding its infrastructure and personnel to support future growth and acquisitions, which may result in an increase in the cost of revenues. The cost of services revenues includes direct costs of software subscription-related services and managed services offerings, including personnel expenses and third-party contractor costs. The company expects growth in its business to result in an increase in the cost of services revenues in absolute dollars, but it may decrease as a percentage of revenues as operations scale.

Operating Income
The company regularly reviews various metrics to evaluate growth trends, measure performance, make financial projections and strategic decisions. Non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, are calculated in addition to GAAP results and are presented as supplemental disclosures. These measures are used by management to compare operating results across accounting periods and for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes. They are also believed to provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the company's results, prospects, and liquidity. However, it is noted that definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those presented by other companies and comparability may be limited. The company encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by an increase in non-GAAP gross profit, offset by increases in non-GAAP operating expenses, including research and development, sales and marketing teams, and technology infrastructure. The company intends to continue investing in its sales and marketing capabilities to increase brand awareness, and expects these costs to increase as it grows its business and expands its market and partner ecosystem penetration.

Interest Expense
The text describes the concept of interest expense, net and interest income. Interest expense is the amount of interest payments and financing costs on a company's debt facility that exceeds interest income for a given period. This expense can vary due to changes in the level of debt outstanding and interest rates on the debt. It can also include adjustments to the fair value of contracts that hedge currency risks and changes in the settlement value of future payment obligations. Interest income, on the other hand, is earnings on investments of a company's cash on hand and funds held for customers related to managed outsourcing services. This income can vary based on fluctuations in the level of available funds for investment and the rate of return available in the market on such funds.

Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $303.1 million and retained earnings of $21.9 million. They received $423.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of 23,812,216 shares of class A common stock on July 31, 2020, which was used to pay off the term loan facility. The net proceeds remaining after payment of offering costs are being used for working capital and other corporate purposes. The company believes that their existing cash resources and $100 million bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet their capital requirements and fund operations for at least the next 12 months. However, if these sources are insufficient, they may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow from their banks. In 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $59.5 million, a decrease of $33.0 million from 2019. Cash used in investing activities was $44.4 million in 2020, an increase of $6.8 million from 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in systax. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $213.6 million in 2020, an increase of $244.2 million from 2019, primarily due to the net proceeds received from the offering. The company uses free cash flow as a critical measure in the evaluation of liquidity and considers it to be an important measure for investors. Free cash flow decreased by $5.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a net decrease in cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow margin decreased in 2020 by 390 basis points compared to 2019, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations during a period of expansion of total revenues. The company maintains trust accounts with financial institutions for tax remittance functions and has legal ownership over the accounts utilized for this purpose. Funds held for customers are not commingled with their operating funds.

Debt
The company states that it does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The company entered into a credit agreement with a bank on March 31, 2020, consisting of a $175 million term loan and a $100 million committed line of credit, which was subsequently amended to allow another bank to be a party. The net proceeds from the term loan were used to fund a portion of the distribution made to stockholders on May 29, 2020. The line of credit matures in March 2025 and had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020. The credit agreement is collateralized by certain assets of the company and contains financial and operating covenants that the company is in compliance with as of December 31, 2020.
