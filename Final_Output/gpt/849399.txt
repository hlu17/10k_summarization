Business Overview
NortonLifeLock is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions, serving nearly 80 million users in over 150 countries. The company aims to prevent, detect, and restore potential damages caused by cybercriminals. They have acquired Avira, a cybersecurity and privacy solutions provider in Europe and emerging markets, to accelerate their international growth. NortonLifeLock allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The allocation of purchase price requires significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Third-party valuation specialists are also utilized for certain estimates. Unforeseen events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of the assumptions, estimates, or actual results.

Results of Operations
The text presents consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated, showing that net revenues increased due to an increase in sales of consumer security and identity and protection products, offset by a decrease from the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions and revenue recognized during an additional week in fiscal 2020. The company monitors several performance metrics to measure current and future performance, including direct customer revenues, average direct customer count, and ARPU. The company settled convertible notes, sold property, borrowed funds, entered into agreements with Broadcom, completed a restructuring plan, and acquired Avira during the period. The company also sold land and buildings and recognized a gain on sale.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenues for fiscal year 2021 decreased by $31 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to lower royalty charges and technical support costs. However, there was an increase in commissions due to higher investments in affiliate marketing programs. In fiscal year 2020, the cost of revenues decreased by $62 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower technical support and service costs, but there was an increase in royalty charges. Additionally, in fiscal year 2019, the company experienced higher inventory write-offs of $10 million due to the discontinuation of their consumer hardware product line.

Operating Income
The company's sales and marketing expenses decreased by $125 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a decrease in shared facility and IT costs by $147 million, partially offset by an increase in advertising and promotional expenses by $12 million. Research and development expenses decreased by $61 million, primarily due to a decrease in shared facility and IT costs by $44 million and a decrease in compensation by $17 million. General and administrative expenses decreased by $153 million, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expenses by $70 million, shared facility and IT costs by $55 million, and outside services expenses by $43 million, partially offset by an additional legal accrual of $25 million relating to an ongoing civil lawsuit. Non-operating income, net of expense, decreased by $488 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, mainly due to the absence of gains from the sale of equity method investment in Digicert and the sale of ID Analytics Solutions.
