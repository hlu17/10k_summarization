Business Overview
Slack is a business technology platform that helps people work together more effectively, connect their software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. It has broad applicability and can be used for various tasks such as reviewing job candidates, coordinating election coverage, diagnosing network problems, negotiating budgets, and organizing disaster response teams. Slack allows users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications. Slack generates revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions, with paid customers typically paying monthly or annually based on the number of users they have on the platform. It offers four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of organizations, ranging from free to enterprise grid. Slack serves organizations of all sizes across various industries and is currently used in over 150 countries and available in ten languages. The platform has experienced rapid growth in recent years, with revenue of $902.6 million in 2021, representing annual growth of 43%. However, the company has generated net losses in recent years and plans to continue investing in adding organizations to Slack to increase revenue and eventually reach profitability.

Results of Operations
Slack's revenue increased by 57% to $229.9 million for the year ending January 31, 2020, due to expansion within existing paid customers and new paid customers. The number of paid customers increased by 25% compared to the previous year, and revenue generated from paid customers over $100,000 increased to 46%. However, cost of revenue increased by 89%, primarily due to stock-based compensation, third-party hosting costs, personnel costs, and facility and IT-related overhead costs. Research and development expenses increased by 190%, sales and marketing expenses increased by 73%, and general and administrative expenses increased by 132%. Interest expense increased by $0.4 million due to revolving credit facility fees, while interest income and other income increased by $4.8 million primarily due to an increase in interest income and net gains from strategic investments.

Revenues
Slack generates most of its revenue through sales of subscriptions to organizations, recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period. The subscriptions are generally non-cancellable and do not contain general rights of return. Slack also provides professional services to organizations, but this revenue has not been significant to date. Revenue increased 43% YoY, primarily due to expansion within existing paid customers and the addition of new paid customers. Cost of revenue increased 25% YoY, driven by an increase in hosting costs, personnel costs, and credit card processing fees. Operating expenses decreased for research and development and general and administrative, but increased for sales and marketing. Interest expense increased due to contractual interest expense and amortization of notes issued in April 2020. Interest income and other income, net increased primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from strategic investments and net foreign exchange gains. The benefit from income taxes was $0.3 million, primarily resulting from the tax benefit of stock-based compensation in foreign jurisdictions.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenue for Slack mostly includes expenses related to hosting the platform and providing customer support for paid users. These expenses include employee compensation, payments to outside service providers, and third-party hosting costs. As Slack grows its business and revenue, it expects its cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollar amounts.

Operating Income
Slack's research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and allocated overhead, focusing on maintaining and enhancing existing functionality of the platform, as well as developing new features and enhancements. Sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs, marketing and business development programs, and sales commissions, with plans to increase investment in direct sales and brand and product marketing efforts. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams, with an expected increase in size to support business growth and costs related to operating as a public company. Slack also provides non-GAAP financial information, including key business metrics used to measure performance and make strategic decisions, and defines a paid customer as an organization with three or more users on a paid subscription plan.

Interest Expense
In April 2020, a private offering of $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due April 15, 2025 was completed. Interest expense post-issuance consists mainly of contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs on the notes. Interest income and other income, net primarily includes interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, the change in fair value of strategic investments, and gains or losses on foreign currency exchange.

Liquidity
As of January 31, 2021, Slack's sources of liquidity were $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $505.9 million in marketable securities, with 95% of all cash and cash equivalents held in the United States. The company has historically financed operations primarily through the issuance of convertible preferred stock, notes, common stock, and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions, and has generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. Slack expects to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future due to investments it intends to make to grow its business, and may require additional capital resources. Slack entered into a $215 million revolving credit and guaranty agreement in May 2019, and completed a private offering of $862.5 million in notes in April 2020. Slack believes that its current liquidity will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months, but its future capital requirements will depend on factors such as subscription and net dollar retention rates, research and development efforts, sales and marketing activities, and the introduction of new products and features. Slack may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt, and may also enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies. Slack has agreed to various covenants and agreements in its merger agreement with Salesforce, including agreements to conduct business in the ordinary course and restrictions on certain actions without Salesforce's consent. Slack's largest source of operating cash is cash collections from organizations on a paid subscription plan, and its primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, sales and marketing expenses, and third-party hosting costs. Slack has historically generated negative cash flows from operating activities and has supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds from the private sale of equity securities.

Debt
As of January 31, 2021, the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for off-balance sheet arrangements. The principal contractual commitments consist of convertible senior notes, obligations under leases for office space and datacenter operations, and future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments. The convertible senior notes are due in April 2025, with a principal amount of $862.5 million. The company has minimum annual commitments of $75.0 million under an amended agreement with Amazon Web Services, which will increase by $5.0 million annually, for a total minimum commitment of $425.0 million. The company also has $38.5 million in standby letters of credit outstanding related to its office facilities in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado. The convertible senior notes are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC Subtopic 470-20, where the liability and equity components of the instrument are separately accounted for. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification, and the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values.
