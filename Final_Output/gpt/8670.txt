Business Overview
ADP is a global provider of cloud-based human capital management (HCM) technology solutions to employers across the world. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ADP continued to provide HCM services to its clients, including processing payroll and tax obligations. The company also released a return-to-workplace solution to assist clients in bringing their employees back to work safely. ADP achieved several milestones during the fiscal year, including the launch of its mobile-first payroll and tax filing product, Roll, and the introduction of the diversity, equity, and inclusion dashboard for its DataCloud platform. The company also rolled out a new user experience for its Run platform and launched a new, native workforce management solution called Timekeeping Plus. ADP drove solid revenue growth of 3% for the year, and its employer services new business bookings increased by 23%. The company's financial condition remains solid, and it is committed to investing in research and development to drive meaningful transformation in the way it operates.

Revenues
ADP's revenues for fiscal 2021 increased due to strong retention, new business bookings, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, and a one percentage point of favorability from foreign currency. However, this increase was partially offset by a one percentage point of pressure from their interest earned on funds held for clients. The employer services client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2021 improved 170 basis points to 92.2%. Meanwhile, PEO services' revenues increased 7%, and PEO services' revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-through costs increased 8% in fiscal 2021. PEO services' earnings before income taxes increased 18% in fiscal 2021 due to increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in expenses. ADP indemnity paid a premium of $260 million in July 2021 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP indemnity for the fiscal 2022 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2021 reinsurance policy.

Operating Income
ADP, a company that provides human resources management solutions, uses adjusted results and non-GAAP metrics in addition to its US GAAP results to evaluate its operating performance and plan for future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, and organic constant currency. ADP provides a discussion of why it believes these measures are important and reconciles them to comparable GAAP financial measures in the accompanying financial tables under the "non-GAAP financial measures" section. In fiscal 2021, ADP saw an increase in earnings before income taxes due to revenue increases and margin increases resulting from operational efficiencies and decreased costs related to transformation initiatives, legal settlements, and excess capacity headcount actions. However, there were offsetting factors, including increased incentive compensation costs and decreased interest earned on funds held for clients. ADP's adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin exclude certain interest amounts, legal settlements, gain on sale of assets, net charges related to transformation initiatives, and net severance charges.

Liquidity
As of June 30, 2021, the company had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds. The company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations, committed credit facilities of $9.7 billion, and access to debt financing from capital markets will be sufficient to meet its operating, investing, and financing activities, including regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. However, the company acknowledges the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to evaluate its financial condition and liquidity. For client funds liquidity, the company has the ability to borrow through its financing arrangements under its short-term commercial paper program and short-term reverse repurchase agreements in the US, Canada, and the UK, as well as its committed credit facilities and corporate liquidity. The company's cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities increased due to a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities, the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities, and a net increase in cash flow from client funds obligations due to the timing of impounds from clients and payments to clients' employees and other payees, and proceeds from debt issuances. The company also purchased approximately 8.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2021. The company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program based on several factors, including actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

Debt
The text summarizes contractual obligations of the company as of June 30, 2021. These obligations include debt principal and interest payments, facilities and equipment leases, purchase obligations, compensation and benefits, and tax benefits. The company also has obligations for the remittance of funds relating to payroll and payroll tax filing services. The company has senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, and 2030 and may revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. The company obtains short-term funding requirements related to client funds through the issuance of commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements. The company has credit facilities to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes. The company's investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans, or sub-prime home equity loans. The company's client funds investment strategy is structured to allow averaging through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of investments out to five and ten years. The company expects capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $200 million and $225 million.
