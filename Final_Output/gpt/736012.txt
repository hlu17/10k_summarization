Revenues
The company's sales and marketing expenses increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to building and training a sales department for a new commercial product and a dedicated marketing budget. The total revenue decreased in 2020 due to the company not meeting sales projections for their TraceCop product line. The company expects product revenues to increase in the future by increasing sales to existing and new customers. The company did not make any export sales due to focusing on domestic revenue sales, and they may face currency exchange risks if they do in the future. The company's sales cycle causes an increase in receivables at the end of each month, leading to an inflated comparative relationship between revenue and accounts receivable. The company expects this monthly trend to continue due to sales forecast and planning meetings held at the beginning of each month, sales calls in the middle, and closing sales in the latter half of the month.

Gross Profit Margin
The gross profit of a company decreased by 52.9% from $8.3 million in 2019 to $3.9 million in 2020. The percentage of gross profit as a percentage of net revenue also decreased from 60.8% in 2019 to 59.1% in 2020. The decrease in gross profit was due to higher labor costs related to certain projects. Several factors can impact gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, including changes in product mix, channels of distribution, sales volume, manufacturing costs, labor costs, pricing strategies, and fluctuations in sales of integrated third-party products.

Interest Expense
The company's interest expense decreased from $46,000 in 2019 to $6,000 in 2020 due to factors including having a zero balance under an unsecured revolving promissory note and declining balances in financial leases.
