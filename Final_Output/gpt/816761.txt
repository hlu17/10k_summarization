Business Overview
Teradata Corporation is a multi-cloud data warehouse platform provider that enables companies to integrate and simplify their data and analytic ecosystems to derive business value from diverse data types. Its platform, Teradata Vantage, runs across on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud environments and is supported by business consulting and support services to extract insights from a company's entire data and analytics ecosystem. To drive operational excellence and become a cloud-first growth company, Teradata is realigning and streamlining its operations by reducing its workforce and rationalizing its real estate footprint. The company is also focusing on significant product expansion of its Teradata Vantage platform, expanding its customer base, increasing diversity and inclusiveness, and driving operational excellence and agility. Teradata measures its progress using annual recurring revenue, public cloud annual recurring revenue, and remaining performance obligation/backlog.

Results of Operations
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update in July 2019, which aims to simplify certain disclosures in financial condition and results of operations by eliminating year-to-year comparisons between prior periods previously disclosed. As a result, the current year annual report only includes disclosures on results of operations for fiscal year 2020 versus 2019, and discussions of fiscal year 2019 versus 2018 can be found in the company's annual report filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.

Revenues
In 2020, Teradata's total revenue decreased by 3%, or $63 million, compared to 2019. However, recurring revenue grew by 7%, driven by the company's move to subscription-based transactions from perpetual software licenses and hardware transactions. For 2021, Teradata expects mid- to high-single digit percentage growth in ARR and recurring revenue, while public cloud ARR is expected to increase by at least 100%. Total revenue is expected to grow at a low-single-digit percentage in 2021, considering the growth in recurring revenue offset by reduced perpetual software licenses and hardware revenue and reduced consulting services revenue. Teradata's ARR is composed of three main categories: subscription and public cloud-related ARR, perpetual license maintenance and software upgrade rights-related ARR, and subscription-based managed services ARR. Teradata will be realigning its ARR and revenue disclosures in 2021, removing managed services and third-party software from subscription-based ARR and recurring revenue. The company manages its business under three geographic regions: Americas, EMEA, and APJ.

Operating Income
In 2020, there was an increase in SG&A expenses compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, the amortization of capitalized sales compensation, and investments in go-to-market and customer success teams. R&D expenses also increased due to the vsp and a re-prioritization of strategic initiatives, with reduced spending on de-prioritized initiatives, and increased investments in cloud transformations.

Liquidity
Teradata, the cloud-based data analytics firm, has reported an increase in cash and cash equivalents to $529m at the end of 2020, up $35m from the previous year, despite repurchasing $100m of company stock. Operating cash flows rose $119m, to $267m, due to better working capital management. The company spent $58m on restructuring and reorganisation of its operations and go-to-market functions to align with its strategy. Although the pandemic had not had a significant impact on its financial results in 2020, Teradata reviewed its capital projects to ensure it only spent on essential projects. It has also managed spending on travel, third-party services and other expenses. The company does not expect the pandemic to have a significant adverse effect on its liquidity.

Debt
The company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" on January 1, 2019, which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. The company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. Material operating leases consist of automobiles in certain countries and real estate including office, storage, and parking space, while finance leases primarily consist of equipment financed for the purpose of delivering services to customers. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date, with operating lease liabilities representing the present value of lease payments not yet paid and operating lease assets representing the right to use an underlying asset. The present value of lease payments not yet paid is determined using the rate implicit in the lease, except for real estate leases which use the incremental borrowing rate. Variable rental escalation clauses and renewal or termination options are factored into the determination of lease payments and terms. Lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Long-term debt and minimum debt obligations, as well as leases and minimum lease obligations, are discussed in notes to the consolidated financial statements. The company does not participate in off-balance sheet arrangements or financial partnerships. Changes in judgments and estimates, such as the likelihood of renewal options, impairments, or the incremental borrowing rate, could impact the amounts of assets or liabilities recorded or cost or expense recognized between periods.
