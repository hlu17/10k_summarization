Business Overview
The company is a pioneer and leader in biometric identification and authentication software, providing highly reliable identification of a person's identity through unique human characteristics. Their products are used to manage and issue secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, driver's licenses, and access control credentials, as well as providing law enforcement with integrated mugshot, fingerprint livescan, and investigative capabilities. The company also provides comprehensive authentication security software using biometrics to secure physical and logical access to facilities or computer networks or internet sites. Their patented IWS Biometric EngineÂ® is a biometric identity and authentication database built for multi-biometric enrollment, management, and authentication, and is hardware agnostic, allowing different types of biometrics to be operated simultaneously. They also offer secure credential solutions for designing and creating smart digital identification wristbands and badges for access control systems. The company is a developer of a biometric-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) cloud-based service, Imageware Authenticate, offering multi-factor authentication for the enterprise and across industries, including workforce and customer offerings. Their law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints, and other biometrics, as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless, or web-based platform. However, the company's financial performance may be impacted by the worldwide economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are unable to predict the full extent of its impact on their operations and financial performance.

Revenues
Identity management software company, ImageWare Systems, reported a 78% increase in software and royalty revenue of approximately $383,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by increased identification project related revenue and sales of additional software licenses. However, lower law enforcement project related revenue, royalty revenue, and boxed identity management software sales offset some of the gains. Services revenue increased $937,000, primarily due to an increase in the service element of project-related work. The company plans to expand its identity platform products, including its biometric smart access cards and law enforcement offerings, to improve functionality and value to the customer. The impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and financial performance remains uncertain. The company applies the five-step model of ASC 606 for revenue recognition and discloses revenue by classes of similar products and services.

Gross Profit Margin
The company's software and royalty gross profit increased by 81% or approximately $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to higher software and royalty revenue of approximately $383,000 combined with higher software and royalty cost of revenue of $18,000 for the same period. The revenue increase with only a minimal increase in software and royalty cost of revenue reflects extremely low third-party software costs. Hardware and consumables gross profit increased by approximately $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the 2019 period, due to lower hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $12,000 combined with lower cost of hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $14,000. Services gross profit increased by approximately $359,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to higher service revenue of approximately $937,000 combined with higher service cost of revenue of $578,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue from 66% in the year ended December 31, 2019, to 46% in the corresponding period of 2020 reflects the one-time impact of additional service costs incurred in the completion of the service element for a particular customer. Gross profit related to maintenance revenue decreased by 2% or approximately $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to lower maintenance revenue of approximately $29,000 combined with higher cost of maintenance revenue of approximately $23,000. The decrease in maintenance revenue results from the timing of maintenance revenue recognition related to a certain customer combined with the expiration of certain maintenance contracts.

Liquidity
The company generated approximately $15.5 million in cash from financing activities in 2020, which included $12.06 million from the sale of 12,060 shares of Series D Preferred stock, $900,000 from the issuance of related party notes payable, and $1.57 million from the issuance of a PPP loan. The company also generated approximately $2.36 million from the sale of 15.7 million shares of common stock. The company used cash to repay certain related party notes payable and pay dividends on Series B Preferred stock. There was no net cash used or generated from investing activities in 2020. The company expects its principal uses of cash in the future to be for product development, intellectual property, and general working capital. The company entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, which committed to purchasing up to $10.25 million of the company's common stock. The company sold 5.7 million shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in 2020. The company also completed private placements of 12,060 shares of its Series D Preferred stock, resulting in gross proceeds of $12.06 million. The company issued Series D preferred shares at a purchase price of $1,000 per share to certain accredited investors pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement. Holders of Series D preferred shares can convert them into common stock at any time after 90 days following the issuance date. Dividends on Series D preferred shares will be paid at a rate of 4% per share per annum in cash or shares of Series D preferred. The company and investors also executed a Registration Rights Agreement, a Series C Exchange Agreement, and a Term Loan and Security Agreement. The bridge loan received by the company in September 2020 is due and payable in arrears on the earlier of the loan conversion date or six months after the disbursement of the bridge loan. All amounts due and payable pursuant to the bridge loan are automatically convertible into shares of Series D preferred at closing. As of December 31, 2020, the company had negative working capital of approximately $19.3 million, which includes $24.1 million of derivative liabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic may affect the company's operations and those of third parties on which the company relies, reducing its ability to access capital and negatively impacting its short-term and long-term liquidity. To address its working capital requirements, management has instituted cost-cutting measures and intends to seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. However, there are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support the company's projected cash shortfall, and there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, and did not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts, which would have exposed them to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk. The company's corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, occupying approximately 500 square feet of office space at a cost of $2,000 per month on a month-to-month basis. The company also occupied office spaces in Ottawa, Portland, and Mexico City at varying costs until the expiration of their respective leases. The company has recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liability for their leased office spaces in accordance with ASC 842, and has utilized practical expedients to not reassess certain lease and nonlease components. The company has also entered a subleasing agreement for their previously occupied corporate headquarters located in San Diego.
