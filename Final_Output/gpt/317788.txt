The company's net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased from $33,670 in the year ended March 31, 2020, to $62,795 in the year ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts. The increase in total costs of revenues and operating expenses from $125,503 in the year ended March 31, 2020, to $254,370 in the year ended March 31, 2021, was a result of continued growth including the acquisitions of Mobile Posse and Appreciate.
