Business Overview
Asure Software provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in the US. Its solution strategy addresses HR complexity, allocation of human and financial capital, and building great teams, which are the primary challenges that prevent businesses from growing. Asure HCM reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity while managing the complete employment lifecycle. Its primary functions include payroll and tax, human resources, time and attendance, HR services, and data integration. Asure sells its solutions through both direct and partner models, and it has two types of partners: reseller partners and referral partners. Asure focuses on less densely populated US metropolitan cities, where fewer of its competitors have a presence.

Revenues
Asure Software generates revenues from recurring revenues, implementation and other revenues. The company expects its revenues to increase as it introduces new applications, expands its client base and renews and expands relationships with existing clients. Recurring revenues constitute the majority of Asure's revenues and include fees for payroll, payroll tax, time and labor management, and other Asure HCM solutions. These revenues are typically derived from fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Asure does not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with them. The company also generates recurring revenue from its reseller partners that license its solutions. Asure's professional services, hardware, and other revenues represent implementation fees, one-time consulting projects, on-premise maintenance, and hardware devices to enhance its software products. The company collects funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. Asure's revenue mix varies by product, and its total customer base is widely spread across industries with HCM sales concentrated in small to mid-size businesses. The company sells its HCM products primarily in the United States and continues to actively explore other opportunities to acquire additional products or technologies to complement its current software and services.

Gross Profit Margin
In 2020, the consolidated gross profit of a company decreased by 12.1% compared to the previous year, due to lower sales volume primarily caused by COVID-19, investment in HCM service resources and personnel, maintaining COVID-related tax codes, increased amortization of capitalized software costs, and migration to secure cloud hosting services. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues was also lower in 2020 compared to 2019. The cost of sales includes direct product costs, compensation for operations and related consulting expenses, hardware expenses, facilities and related expenses, and intangible amortization related to developed and acquired technology.

Interest Expense
The interest expense and other net for the year 2020 was $2,221 compared to $16,005 in 2019. The interest expense and other primarily consists of interest expense on notes payable. In 2019, the interest expense and other primarily included interest expense on notes payable.

Liquidity
Asure, a software company, had a working capital of $8,208 at the end of 2020, which decreased by $9,646 from the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents from the divestiture of their workspace management business. Deferred revenue was $5,838 at the end of 2020, an increase of $338 from the previous year, which represents their obligation to perform future services. Operating activities resulted in a net cash used of $1,707 in 2020, primarily driven by net loss and increases in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was $(4,117) in 2019. Investing activities resulted in a net cash used of $(201,134) in 2020, primarily due to the net change in funds held for clients and acquisitions of three payroll processing and payroll tax businesses. Financing activities resulted in a net cash provided of $202,592 in 2020, primarily due to the net change in client funds, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and proceeds from note payable. Asure's principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, and $4,500 available for borrowing under their Wells Fargo revolver. Asure raised gross proceeds of $21,700 from an underwritten public offering of 2,990,000 shares of their common stock in December 2020. Asure was not compliant with their minimum EBITDA financial covenant as of March 31, 2020, due to the effects of COVID-19 on their business. As a result, they negotiated and entered a waiver and amendment to their credit agreement, which reduced their facility from $30,000 to $15,000 and reset their financial covenants. As of December 31, 2020, Asure was in compliance with their financial covenants under the amendment and all payments remained current. Asure may need to raise additional capital in the future to grow their existing software operations and seek additional strategic acquisitions.
