Business Overview
Progress Software Corporation provides comprehensive product solutions for developing, deploying and managing high-impact business applications. The company is committed to the developer community, operating as three distinct segments: OpenEdge, Data Connectivity and Integration, and Application Development and Deployment. The company's strategic plan and operating model involves allocating the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values, which are determined using a discounted cash flow model. Key estimates used in valuing intangible assets include future expected cash flows, discount rates, attrition rates of customers, and expected technology life cycles. The company's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but material differences in fair values may result if management made different estimates or judgments.

Results of Operations
Progress Software Corporation's total revenue increased in fiscal year 2020 due to the acquisitions of Ipswitch and Chef, which contributed $67.5 million and $3.8 million in revenue, respectively. However, the increase was offset by a decrease in license sales in the data connectivity and integration segment. The company's gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue and the decrease in the amortization of intangibles, offset slightly by the decrease of license revenue and increase of cost of maintenance and services. Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while product development expenses remained flat. General and administrative expenses increased slightly primarily due to higher personnel-related costs. The company adopted the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, ASC 606, effective December 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method. Progress Software Corporation reported an increase in total revenue in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. Changes in prices between fiscal year 2018 and 2019 did not significantly affect revenue. License revenue increased due to the acquisition of Ipswitch and higher sales in the data connectivity and integration segment. Maintenance revenue also increased due to the Ipswitch acquisition and a slight increase in the application development and deployment segment, while professional services revenue increased due to higher OpenEdge professional services revenue. Total revenue generated in North America and outside North America increased, with a significant increase in the EMEA region due to the Ipswitch acquisition. Gross profit increased due to increases in license and maintenance revenue, but sales and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses increased due to increased personnel-related expenses resulting from the acquisition of Ipswitch. Income from operations decreased due to the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as well as increases in operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring expenses and acquisition expenses recorded in fiscal year 2019 as a result of the acquisition of Ipswitch. The company's effective income tax rate decreased due to the loss incurred by the US operations in fiscal year 2019 resulting from the amortization and impairment of intangibles, and the majority of international profits were earned in a jurisdiction with a statutory tax rate of 10%.

Liquidity
Progress Software Corporation reported a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $67.7m from the end of fiscal year 2019. The decrease was primarily due to payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $213.1m, dividend payments of $29.9m, repurchases of common stock of $60.0m, payments of debt obligations in the amount of $11.3m, and purchases of property and equipment of $6.5m. However, these cash outflows were offset by cash inflows from operations of $144.8m, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $98.5m, $5.8m in cash received from the issuance of common stock, a positive effect of exchange rates on cash of $3.1m, and proceeds from the sale of intangible assets of $0.9m. Progress Software Corporation holds $24.7m and $23.1m in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in its foreign subsidiaries at November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in subsequent quarters consistent with its capital allocation strategy. The company's credit agreement provides for a $301m secured term loan and a $100m secured revolving credit facility. The text outlines the repayment schedule and terms of a credit facility, which includes a term loan and revolving line of credit. The term loan is structured with four payments increasing in value, followed by three payments of $9.4 million each and a final payment of the remaining principal amount. The credit facility can be prepaid without penalty and contains customary covenants related to financial ratios. The company has entered into an interest rate swap contract to manage variability in cash flows associated with variable rate debt. The revolving line of credit can be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed until its maturity date, and as of November 30, 2020, $98.5 million was outstanding. The company has generated increased cash flows from operations due to higher operating income and decreased operating expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accounts receivable and deferred revenue have increased, primarily due to acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities was impacted by the acquisition of two companies, while financing activities included proceeds from debt and share repurchases. The company includes standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in its licensing agreements, but historically, the costs associated with these provisions have been insignificant. The company believes that its existing cash balances, funds generated from operations, and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.

Debt
The text states that the company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation s-k. It then provides a table detailing the company's contractual obligations as of November 30, 2020. This includes monthly interest payments on long-term debt, fixed or minimum amounts due under purchase obligations for support service agreements, and unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties. The company had $6.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and an additional $0.4 million in interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities. The company is only able to estimate a payment of $0.3 million related to an audit settlement for FY21, and cannot provide a reliable estimate for the remaining balance of tax liabilities. More information on these obligations can be found in the company's consolidated financial statements in item 8 of the form 10-K.
