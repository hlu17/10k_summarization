Business Overview
Smith Micro applies FASB ASC Topic No. 805 for accounting its acquisitions, recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair values separate from goodwill. The company provides software solutions to enhance mobile experiences for wireless and cable service providers globally, offering products for creating, sharing, and monetizing rich content. The company experienced an increase in wireless revenues in 2020 due to a higher number of subscribers, but the growth of SafePath subscribers was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. Commsuite revenues were stable. The company received $4.2 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in 2018.

Results of Operations
The majority of the company's revenues and accounts receivable come from sales to T-Mobile and its affiliates. In 2020, revenues increased by 18%, primarily due to a higher number of SafePath subscribers and additional revenues from the Circle acquisition. Gross profit increased by 17% due to higher revenues and stable variable costs. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 42% due to headcount-related expenses and increased intangibles amortization related to the Circle acquisition. Research and development expenses increased by 63% due to additional headcount-related expenses and external contract development costs to support SafePath development. General and administrative expenses increased by 29% due to an increase in non-cash stock compensation, variable compensation expense, and fees associated with the Circle acquisition. The company recorded a gain on the sale of software products in 2020 and 2019. Interest income decreased, and the current provision for income tax expense consists of state income tax minimums, foreign tax withholdings, and foreign income taxes. The company retained a valuation allowance related to its U.S.-based deferred tax assets of $49.4 million at December 31, 2020.
