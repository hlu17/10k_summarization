Business Overview
The annual report for fiscal year 2021 of Jack in the Box, a quick-service restaurant chain primarily operating in the western and southern United States, highlights a general description of the business and fiscal year highlights. The report recommends reading the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to understand the significant factors that influenced the company's performance during the fiscal year. The report compares the 53-week period ended October 3, 2021, and the 52-week period ended September 27, 2020, for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, the company operated and franchised 2,218 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, deriving revenue from retail sales at company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties, franchise fees, and contributions for advertising and other services from franchisees. The report provides a detailed breakdown of the company's financial performance in terms of company restaurant sales and costs, same-store sales, food and packaging costs, payroll and employee benefit costs, occupancy and other costs, franchise rental revenues, franchise royalties and other, franchise contributions for advertising and other services, and franchise support and other costs. The report also outlines the impact of various factors such as average check growth, menu price increases, an increase in the average number of restaurants, and the impact of the 53rd week on the company's performance. The report highlights the company's expected annual commodity cost inflation and wage inflation for fiscal year 2022.

Results of Operations
The text presents an analysis of consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, with a table that shows income and expense items as a percentage of total revenues. The percentages may not add up due to rounding. The table includes percentages of franchise rental revenues, franchise royalties and other, franchise contributions for advertising and other services, and earnings from continuing operations and before income taxes. System sales include both company and franchised restaurant sales, and while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues, royalty revenues, marketing fees, and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised sales. The text also provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings, in thousands.

Revenues
The revenue and systemwide sales for the year 2021 have increased by 12.0% and 13.1% respectively, compared to the previous year. This increase includes the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental revenue of approximately $21.3 million and incremental systemwide sales of $77.9 million. Excluding the 53rd week, the systemwide sales for the year 2021 increased by 11.0%.

Operating Income
The company's operating cash flows have increased by $57.6 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $27.4 million and favorable changes in working capital of $30.2 million. The favorable changes in working capital were mainly due to a favorable change in accounts receivable of $32.9 million resulting from the repayment of franchise marketing and rent deferrals provided in the prior year, and a favorable change in accrued liabilities of $24.8 million, mainly from an increase in deferred rent income driven by collections of October rent in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. However, there was an unfavorable change in operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $25.3 million due to payment of October rent in the 53rd week and the repayment of deferrals received from landlords in the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA for the year increased by 21%, inclusive of the favorable 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in incremental adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 million. For the year, the adjusted EBITDA increased by 25.7%.

Interest Expense
Interest expense, net, increased by $0.7 million in 2021 due to interest related to the 53rd contributing an additional $1.2 million and lower interest income of $0.4 million. However, this increase was partially offset by lower average borrowings resulting from paying down variable funding notes. More information on the company's obligations and expected payments can be found in note 7, indebtedness, of the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity
The text discusses the cash flows of a company over the last two fiscal years. The company's cash flows used in financing activities increased by $256.3 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to the repayment of $107.9 million of borrowings and an increase in stock repurchases of $44.4 million. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $50.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions and the sale of property and equipment. The composition of capital expenditures in each fiscal year is summarized, with 2021 seeing a $15.1 million increase in purchases of assets intended for sale and leaseback. The company uses sale and leaseback financing to lower the initial cash investment in its restaurants. Certain cash accounts have been established with the indenture trustee for the benefit of the note holders and are restricted in their use, with the master issuer having restricted cash of $18.2 million as of October 3, 2021.

Debt
The cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments for the company include long-term debt of $1,290.3 million on the class A-2 notes, which are subject to certain covenants and restrictions. The company borrowed $107.9 million under the variable funding notes in the second quarter of 2020, which was fully repaid in the second quarter of 2021, and had no outstanding borrowings as of October 3, 2021, with $110.5 million of available borrowing capacity under the variable funding notes. The notes are subject to various rapid amortization events and events of default, but as of October 3, 2021, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenant requirements and was not subject to any rapid amortization events. The company also has non-cancelable purchase commitments related to information technology agreements and volume commitments for beverage products, as well as obligations and the timing of expected payments under its non-qualified defined benefit plan and postretirement healthcare plans.
