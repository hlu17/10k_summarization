Results of Operations
The company has not yet experienced a significant reduction in revenues, but industry consolidation during economic downturns could impact future earnings. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty for the company's short and long-term business outlook. The company believes that developing new energy solutions could lead to increased revenue, but there are no guarantees. The company does not disclose all new product development activities for competitive reasons. Acquisitions and exploring new markets could provide growth opportunities, but their potential for success is uncertain.

Revenues
The company earned $49,438,115 in revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021, which is a significant increase from the $10,028,701 earned in revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020. The revenue was derived from various sources such as cryptocurrency mining, the sale of equipment, solar panels, batteries, design, engineering, and services. The income from the mining segment was a result of bitcoin mining activities in the United States, while the income from the energy segment was from contracts to sell switchgear equipment, perform engineering design, and provide software for distributed energy and microgrid systems. The company also generated services revenue from P2Klabs, and they hope to generate more significant revenue from customers through the sale and licensing of their software platforms and services in the future. However, they are unable to estimate the amount of future revenues from existing or future software contracts. The company does not anticipate earning significant revenues from their gasifier business until they have fully developed their technology and are able to market their products.

Liquidity
The company's primary sources of liquidity for the year ended September 30, 2021, were existing cash and proceeds from share offerings. The company raised net proceeds of approximately $187.2 million from a fully underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock on March 18, 2021. The company also signed an at-the-market offering agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, pursuant to which it may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $500 million of shares of its common stock. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the company issued an aggregate of 3,443,379 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $46.4 million. The company believes that existing cash, cash generated from operations, and the at-the-market offering will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements until it reaches profitability. However, the company's future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including its growth rate, spending to support development efforts, expansion of its sales and marketing, timing of new product introductions, and market acceptance of its products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy its capital requirements, the company may have to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, or open a revolving line of credit with a bank. As of September 30, 2021, the company had total current assets of $57.7 million, total assets of $317.5 million, total current liabilities of $10.1 million, and a working capital surplus of $47.7 million. The company's net loss of $21.8 million was the main component of its negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021, offset mainly by stock-based compensation, impairment expense, and depreciation and amortization. The company's cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021, amounted to $217.7 million, primarily due to acquisitions, purchase of fixed assets, and deposits on mining equipment. The company's cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021, amounted to $268.1 million, primarily consisting of proceeds from offerings and proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options, offset by repayments on promissory notes and finance leases.

Debt
As of September 30, 2021, the company has purchase commitments for miners and other mining equipment amounting to $203.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The company has paid $144.7 million and $4.6 million towards these commitments, respectively. The company also has contingent consideration obligations for GridFabric and Solar Watt Solutions, which may result in the issuance of additional shares and cash consideration, respectively, if certain revenue milestones are achieved. As of September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration for GridFabric was re-measured to $500,000, and all contingent consideration due to GridFabric has been settled subsequent to that date, resulting in the issuance of 8,404 shares of company common stock valued at $150,000. None of the contingent consideration for Solar Watt Solutions has been earned as of September 30, 2021.
