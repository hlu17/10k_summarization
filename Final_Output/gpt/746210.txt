Business Overview
Oblong, Inc. (formerly known as Glowpoint, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation that acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of privately held Delaware corporation, Oblong Industries, Inc., on October 1, 2019, making Oblong Industries a wholly owned subsidiary of Oblong, Inc. The acquisition was made pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger. The company's critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of their consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity
The company had $5,277,000 of cash and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, and incurred net losses of $7,421,000 for the year. Net cash used in operating activities was $6,566,000, and net cash used in investing activities was $31,000 for the year. Net cash provided by financing activities was $7,272,000, primarily attributable to net proceeds from two private placements of common stock and proceeds from a PPP loan. The company had a term loan facility of approximately $5,247,000 outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and entered into an agreement with SVB to accept a one-time cash payment of $2,500,000 in satisfaction of the company's obligations under the SVB loan agreement. The remaining balance of $3,062,000, net of discount, as well as accrued interest, was forgiven and recorded as a gain on extinguishment of debt. As of December 31, 2020, the company had no outstanding obligations under the SVB loan agreement. The company believes that additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital, and there is substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. However, there are certain factors that could affect the company's liquidity in the future, which are discussed in the consolidated financial statements.
