Business Overview
SolarWinds is a company that provides IT infrastructure management software to organizations worldwide. Their products allow businesses to monitor and manage the performance of their IT environments, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid models. They offer a range of infrastructure location-agnostic products to monitor and manage network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures, and IT service desks. SolarWinds intends to continue innovating and investing in product development to bring new products to market and enhance the functionality, ease of use, and integration of their current products to strengthen their overall value proposition in any IT environment.

Results of Operations
SolarWinds' revenue is divided into recurring revenue and perpetual license revenue. The majority of its revenue comes from subscription and maintenance fees. Subscription revenue is primarily derived from fees received for subscriptions to its SaaS offerings, including its MSP products, cloud infrastructure, application performance management, and IT service management products. Revenue from MSP products increases with the addition of end customers served by SolarWinds' MSP customers. Maintenance revenue is derived from the sale of maintenance services associated with its perpetual license products. License revenue comes from the sale of perpetual licenses of its on-premises network, systems, storage, and database management products to new and existing customers. The company has launched subscription pricing options for certain network, systems, and database management products that were historically sold as perpetual licenses. This new option gives customers additional flexibility when purchasing SolarWinds' products. The company plans to continue selling perpetual licenses for these products and not require customers to transition to a subscription pricing model. The subscription pricing option may impact the mix of license and recurring revenue, but this impact is difficult to predict at this time.

Revenues
SolarWinds, a provider of IT management software, reported total revenue of $1.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2020, compared to $932.5 million in 2019. Recurring revenue, which includes subscription and maintenance revenue, represented 86% of total revenue in 2020, up from 82% in 2019. The company's core IT management products, which target IT ops, DevOps, and IT security professionals, generated $716.8 million in revenue in 2020, while MSP products, aimed at managed service providers, generated $302.5 million. SolarWinds' subscription annual recurring revenue was $435.1 million at the end of 2020, up from $371.6 million in 2019, while total annual recurring revenue was $959.7 million, up from $845.1 million in 2019. The company had over 320,000 customers at the end of 2020, with no single country accounting for 10% or more of total revenue. SolarWinds expects its international revenue to increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue as it expands its international sales and marketing efforts. Subscription revenue increased by 23.6% in 2020, while maintenance revenue increased by 7.1%.

Gross Profit Margin
The text discusses the cost of recurring revenue and amortization of acquired technologies for a company. The cost of recurring revenue includes technical support personnel costs, royalty fees, public cloud infrastructure and hosting fees, and overhead costs for subscription revenue and maintenance services. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, and IT costs allocated based on headcount. Amortization of acquired technologies primarily includes amortization related to capitalized costs of technologies acquired in connection with a take private transaction in 2016 and other acquisitions. The company has maintained high levels of operating efficiency and experienced an increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to intellectual property rights. Adjusted EBITDA was $489.7 million for 2020 and $453.6 million for 2019.

Operating Income
The operating expenses of a company include sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses, as well as amortization of acquired intangibles. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and overhead costs, are the most significant component of operating expenses. The company has increased its stock-based compensation expense due to equity awards granted to employees and directors, and intends to continue granting equity awards, resulting in additional stock-based compensation expense in the future. The company's travel costs declined in 2020 due to COVID-19, and it expects this to continue for the duration of the pandemic. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of related personnel costs and digital marketing programs, and the company expects to continue hiring personnel globally to drive new sales and maintenance renewals. Research and development expenses primarily consist of related personnel costs, and the company expects to continue growing its research and development organization, particularly internationally. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for executives, finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative personnel, as well as general restructuring charges, acquisition and spin-off exploration costs, professional fees, and other general corporate expenses. The company provides non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance its understanding and aid in the period-to-period comparison of its performance. The company regularly monitors adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which exclude certain expenses, to assess its operating performance. The company also provides non-GAAP operating income and related non-GAAP margin, which exclude certain expenses, to better compare its operating results to prior periods and peer companies.

Interest Expense
The interest expense, net, of a company decreased by 29.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates on their debt. The weighted-average effective interest rate on their debt was 3.4% in 2020, compared to 5.0% in 2019. Further information on the company's debt can be found in Note 9 of their consolidated financial statements included in their annual report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, the cash and cash equivalents for the company were $370.5 million, with approximately $163.4 million held by its international subsidiaries, of which 39.6% were held in euros. The company intends to either invest its foreign earnings permanently in foreign operations or remit these earnings to its US entities in a tax-free manner with the exception for immaterial state income taxes. The primary source of cash for funding operations and growth has been through cash provided by operating activities. Due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company continues to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on its business and financial position. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, its cash flows from operating activities, and borrowing capacity under its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its operations, debt repayments, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. The investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and intangible assets. The financing cash flows consist primarily of issuance and repayments associated with long-term debt and the proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through equity incentive plans. The company expects the cyber incident to negatively impact revenue, profitability, and cash flows in 2021 and beyond. The company expects to incur significant expenses associated with the cyber incident in future periods, primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations, increased expenses and capital investments associated with its “secure by design” initiatives, increased customer support activities, and increased costs and expenses for insurance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. The exact amount of loss or range of possible loss resulting from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties, or other resolutions of such proceedings and investigations is not possible to estimate at this time.

Debt
The company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships that would have facilitated off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. The estimated cash interest expense is based on an interest rate of 2.90%. The company had a lease agreement that had not commenced prior to year-end, with lease liabilities of around $29.0 million over an 11-year term. Purchase obligations primarily represented outstanding purchase orders for various expenses, while other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included non-current income tax liabilities of $32.7 million. The company's total indebtedness was $1.9 billion, with up to $125.0 million of available borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The first lien credit agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million, consisting of a $25.0 million USD revolving credit facility and a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The agreement also includes a term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,990.0 million, with the right to request additional commitments for new loans subject to compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.75 to 1.00. The first lien term loan will mature on February 5, 2024, and requires equal quarterly repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount.
