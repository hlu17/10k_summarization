Business Overview
When a company acquires another company, it must allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. This process requires significant estimates and assumptions, particularly for intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although these estimates are based on historical experience, market conditions, and information from the acquired company's management, they are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates for valuing intangible assets include expected cash flows, customer attrition rates, trade names and trademarks, expected use of assets, and discount rates. The fair value of deferred revenue obligations is determined using a cost build-up approach, but unanticipated events may affect the accuracy of these estimates.

Revenues
Adobe's financial results for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 were presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The company's subscription revenue is primarily derived from fees for subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services. Adobe has three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. Digital Media revenue increased $1.53 billion during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, driven by increases in revenue associated with its Creative and Document Cloud offerings. Digital Experience revenue increased $330 million during fiscal 2020, primarily due to subscription revenue growth across its offerings. Overall revenue during fiscal 2020 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2019. Adobe is a market leader with its Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, with annualized recurring revenue of $8.72 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively, at the end of fiscal 2020. The company's digital experience segment revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019, driven by an increase in subscription revenue across its offerings.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of subscription revenue has increased due to various factors such as third-party royalties, amortization of purchased intangibles, excess and obsolete inventory, localization costs, and manufacturing costs. The cost of services and other revenue includes employee-related costs, consulting services, training, product support, and media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory sources for Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings. The fluctuations in cost of services and other revenue were due to the discontinuation of transaction-based Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings in Q2 of fiscal year 2020.

Operating Income
The text describes the expenses and changes in various categories for a company. Research and development expenses increased due to investments in new and enhanced offerings and solutions, including hiring software developers. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for personnel, programs aimed at increasing revenue, and advertising. General and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for various personnel and outside legal and accounting fees. Amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates on debt instruments that were refinanced. Investment gains (losses), net decreased primarily due to a gain recognized upon acquisition of a remaining interest in a company. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term fixed income investments, and remained stable due to decreases in interest income offset by a change in methodology of accounting for foreign currency cash flow hedges.

Liquidity
The text summarizes the cash flows of the company for fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The company had a working capital surplus of $2.63 billion in 2020 and a working capital deficit of $1.70 billion in 2019. The primary source of cash for the company is revenue receipts, and the primary uses of cash are stock repurchases, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses, cost of revenue, and business acquisitions. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $5.73 billion, primarily due to net income and increases in deferred revenue, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The net cash used for investing activities in 2020 was $414 million, primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was $3.49 billion, primarily due to payments for treasury stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. The company issued $3.15 billion of senior notes in February 2020, which were used to repay term loans and senior notes. The company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, anticipated cash flows from operations, and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital, operating resource expenditure, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. The company expects to continue its investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems, sales and marketing, product support, administrative staff, and facilities expansion. Cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products, or technologies that are complementary to the company's business.

Debt
As of November 27, 2020, the principal commitments of the company consist of notes, operating leases, royalty agreements, and various service agreements. The carrying value of the notes is $4.12 billion, and the maximum commitment for interest payments is $613 million for the remaining duration of the outstanding notes. The company is in compliance with the financial covenant in its revolving credit agreement, which requires it not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. The company's notes do not contain any financial covenants. The transition tax liability, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. tax act, is approximately $390 million and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The company provides indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products. The company has agreements to indemnify its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while serving at the company's request, and the maximum potential amount of future payments is unlimited, but the company has director and officer insurance coverage that limits its exposure.
