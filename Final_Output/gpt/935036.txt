Debt
The text describes the process of settlement accounts, which involves withdrawing funds from a source account and depositing them into a trust account for the benefit of clients. These funds are then transferred to the intended destination account through "back to back" transactions that are designed to settle at the same time. However, there may be timing differences that result in float balances, which are maintained in accounts separate from corporate assets. Interest earned on these funds is considered in determining fee structures for clients and represents a portion of payment for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of settlement funds was $246.8 million. The company has entered into a credit agreement that matures in April 2024 and has issued senior notes that mature in August 2026. Additionally, the company leases office space and equipment under operating leases that run through October 2028. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, is $24.3 million, and the company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of reserves for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes.
