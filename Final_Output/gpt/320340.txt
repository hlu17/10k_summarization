Business Overview
The company provides technology solutions and processing services to the fintech industry through its subsidiary CoreCard Software and its affiliate companies in Romania, India, and Dubai. The company derives product revenue from licensing its comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers, and processors. Its service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support, processing services, and professional services for software customizations. The company is adding new processing customers at a faster pace than new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. The company is experiencing growth in revenue from its largest customer, referred to as "Customer A," and lost a large customer due to insolvency, referred to as "Customer B." The company opened offices in Dubai and Chennai and hired some of Customer B's employees to convert some of their customers to their processing platform. The company's revenue is based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and has not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's revenue fluctuates from period to period, and its results are not necessarily indicative of future periods. The company maintains a strong cash position and intends to use cash balances to support its operations and expand its operations in the fintech industry through financing growth and acquisitions. The company has authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million, of which $1.6 million was made in 2020.

Results of Operations
The discussion provided should be read alongside the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the annual report.

Gross Profit Margin
The total cost of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was 43 percent of total revenue, compared to 34 percent for the same period in 2019. This increase is primarily due to investments made in processing infrastructure, including hardware and software purchases and additional space in data centers. Cost of revenue includes costs for annual maintenance and support services for licensed customers, professional services, and financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on these revenues can vary depending on customer mix, requirements, project complexity, and the mix of US and offshore employees. The company plans to continue investing in its processing infrastructure to support its growing business and regulatory compliance, which negatively impacted margins in 2020 but is expected to result in future economies of scale. However, this may change if new regulations or processing standards are implemented, resulting in additional costs.

Operating Income
The company's total operating expenses for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 were slightly lower compared to the same period in 2019. This was mainly due to lower research and development expenses, which were caused by lower recognition-based bonus accruals, partially offset by higher payroll and related expenses for additional offshore technical personnel. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher stock compensation and salaries expenses, but marketing expenses decreased as the company placed less focus on marketing initiatives for corecard. The company recorded an investment loss of $1,044,000 in 2020 due to an impairment charge of $1,009,000 on investments resulting from the economic downturn caused by the recent pandemic. Other income, net increased primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash and note receivable balances, partially offset by lower interest rates.

Liquidity
The company had a cash balance of $37,956,000 at the end of 2020, compared to $26,415,000 at the end of 2019. Cash provided by operations in 2020 was $20,966,000, compared to $10,585,000 in 2019, primarily due to lower accounts receivable, an increase in cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation, and non-cash investment losses. The company used $6,875,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software. The company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and plans to use excess cash for opportunities to expand its fintech business. The company made share repurchases of $1.6 million in 2020 under its share repurchase program.
