Business Overview
Citrix is an enterprise software company that aims to provide a consistent and secure work experience, regardless of location. The company offers a digital workspace solution that gives employees the resources they need to do their best work, as well as app delivery and security solutions that deliver applications and data across any network with security, reliability, and speed. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trends driving distributed teams and hybrid work, emphasizing the importance of securely delivering work resources. Citrix has transitioned from offering perpetual licenses to subscription offerings, which are expected to result in more sustainable, recurring revenue growth over time. In 2020, the company delivered strong results, with strong demand for the Citrix Workspace and more customers adopting its cloud offerings. However, the transition of customers from on-premise to cloud-based offerings did not progress as quickly as anticipated due to the pandemic's near-term focus on business critical needs. Citrix continues to invest in innovation and feature development, simplified cloud migration, and performance and reliability to address these challenges. The company has also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wrike, a leader in the SaaS collaborative work management space, for $2.25 billion in cash. Citrix expects the acquisition to have a favorable impact on its fiscal year 2021 SaaS revenues and ARR, as well as increases in cost of net revenues and operating expenses. The impact of the pandemic on Citrix's operations remains uncertain, but the company believes that its solutions and business model are resilient. Citrix's financial performance in 2020 included an increase in subscription revenue, a decrease in product and license revenue, and a decrease in support and services revenue. The company expects total revenue to decrease in Q1 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to revenue directly attributable to business continuity needs related to the pandemic. However, when comparing the 2021 fiscal year to the 2020 fiscal year, Citrix expects total revenue to increase. Both subscription and SaaS ARR increased due to an increase in subscription sales.

Results of Operations
The text discusses the financial results of a company for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the previous year. The company's net revenues increased due to increased demand for on-premise licenses for workspace offerings and cloud adoption of solutions delivered via the cloud. However, product and license revenue decreased due to a shift towards subscription offerings. The company expects revenue from subscriptions to continue to increase in the first quarter of 2021 and the fiscal year 2021. The company's deferred revenue increased due to an increase in subscription revenue, while unbilled revenue increased due to increased customer adoption of multi-year subscription agreements. The company's international revenues increased due to higher revenues in the EMEA region. The cost of subscription, support, and services revenues increased due to increased costs related to providing subscription offerings. The cost of product and license revenues decreased due to the shift towards subscription offerings. The company expects lower sales of their products containing hardware components that have a higher cost than their software products, resulting in a decrease in product and license revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020. Operating expenses are expected to slightly increase during the same periods. The company faces fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and they initiate hedging of currency exchange risks up to 12 months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses to minimize the impact on their operating results. The company's research and development expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to compensation and other employee-related costs and an increase in professional fees. Sales, marketing, and services expenses also increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in variable compensation and an increase in marketing programs but were partially offset by a decrease in costs related to the cancellation of in-person events. General and administrative expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increases in compensation and other employee-related costs, stock-based compensation, and credit loss expense but were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The company's amortization of other intangible assets decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2019. The company's restructuring expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a net decrease in employee severance and related costs and the consolidation of certain leased facilities in 2019, partially offset by the impairment of a right-of-use asset related to a restructuring facility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The company expects interest expense to increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 in anticipation of financing related to the proposed acquisition of Wrike. The company's effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and lower tax rates on earnings generated by their foreign operations that are taxed primarily in Switzerland.

Liquidity

The company expects its cash inflows to continue in 2021 and may raise additional funds through debt or equity securities for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The company's cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased due to cash received from debt offerings and operating activities, partially offset by stock repurchases, cash dividends, tax withholding, and purchases of property and equipment. The company also has an ongoing stock repurchase program and used accelerated share repurchase transactions and open market purchases to repurchase common stock.
