The company's adjusted operating income was $226.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth and future success of ZoomInfo's business depend on many factors, including its go-to-market engine, organic growth, and acquisitions.

Revenues
ZoomInfo derives 99% of its revenue from subscription services, with the remainder coming from recurring usage-based services. The company's subscription contracts range from one to three years and are non-cancellable. ZoomInfo typically bills for services in advance and requires payment at the beginning of each period. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Unearned revenue results from cash received in advance of revenue recognized upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In 2020, revenue was $476.2 million, with an increase of $182.9 million from the previous year. Operating expenses were $331.6 million, an increase of $143 million. The company had over 14,000 customers as of December 31, 2019.

Gross Profit Margin
The text explains that gross profit is revenue minus cost of service, while gross margin is the percentage of gross profit compared to revenue. Gross profit is influenced by factors such as economies of scale, the costs of third-party hosting services and data, amortization of acquired technology, and the expansion of customer support and research organizations. As a result, gross margin is expected to fluctuate depending on these factors.

Operating Income
The text discusses the operating expenses of a company, which include sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, restructuring and transaction expenses, and amortization of acquired intangibles. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses, which include salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, overhead costs, technology, and marketing programs. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and overhead costs to enhance the platform and develop new software products. General and administrative expenses include employee-related costs and professional fees. The company uses non-GAAP measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share, to evaluate its operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items, including non-cash expenses and episodic expenses. Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income exclude non-cash expenses and episodic expenses, as well as interest expense, other income or expenses, and income tax expense. The company expects to continue investing in sales and marketing and research and development to drive growth and customer value. The company anticipates that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will stay consistent or modestly decrease, while sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease as equity-based compensation expense related to the modification of HSKB awards and triggered by the IPO become a less significant component of overall sales and marketing expense. The company also expects amortization of other acquired intangibles to only increase if it makes additional acquisitions in the future, and restructuring and transaction expenses to be correlated with future acquisition activity or strategic restructuring activities, which could be greater than or less than historic levels. Adjusted operating income margin represents adjusted operating income divided by the sum of revenue and the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue. The company expects adjusted operating income margin to modestly increase in the long term.

Interest Expense
Interest expense is the amount of money paid for debt obligations, including interest, amortization of debt discounts, and debt issuance costs. This expense may be lowered after repaying some of the outstanding debt with funds from the IPO. However, future changes in variable interest rates or the issuance of more debt may lead to an increase in interest expense.

Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, ZoomInfo had $269.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $30.6 million in short-term investments, $1.2 million in restricted cash, and $100.0 million available under its first lien revolving credit facility. The company believes that its cash flows from operations, existing available cash and cash equivalents, and other external financing sources will be sufficient to fund its operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Subscription prepayments are a substantial source of ZoomInfo's cash, and it had unearned revenue of $222.7 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $221.3 million is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months. ZoomInfo's capital expenditures increased by 24% to $16.8 million in 2020 compared to the previous year. The company's net cash provided by operations was $169.6 million in 2020, primarily due to non-cash charges of $201.5 million and a change in operating assets net of operating liabilities of $4.5 million. Cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $113.3 million, and cash provided from financing activities was $172.2 million, primarily from the IPO proceeds of $1,023.7 million. The company expects to continue investing in property and equipment and pursuing acquisitions as part of its business strategy.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements for ZoomInfo Technologies, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. The company's indebtedness is discussed in note 8 of its consolidated financial statements, including interest incurred on amounts borrowed, which is based on relative borrowing levels and fluctuations in variable interest rates. The company is unable to quantify its future obligations related to interest, so no amounts have been included in the contractual obligations table. The company's remaining debt principal repayment obligation is $756.4 million, due in its entirety on February 1, 2026. The company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to restrictions in its credit agreements. In February 2021, ZoomInfo completed an offering of $350.0 million in senior notes due 2029 and used the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, to prepay $356.4 million of its first lien term loans. The company also entered into an amendment to its first lien credit agreement, which included an increase in the aggregate commitments to $250.0 million under its first lien revolving credit facility, the addition of ZoomInfo Technologies LLC as a co-borrower, the repricing of its first lien term loan facility and first lien revolving credit facility, and an extension of the maturity date of its first lien revolving credit facility to November 2025.
