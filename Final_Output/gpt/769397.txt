Results of Operations
Autodesk continues to conduct business during the COVID-19 pandemic with modifications to employee travel, work locations, and virtualization, and postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events. In the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2021, most of Asia Pacific and Continental Europe experienced usage levels above pre-COVID-19 levels, while usage rates in the US and UK remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. The company experienced revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2021, due to record EBA, strong subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales, and continued sequential growth in new business. Autodesk also took action to support its customers during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and deferred a 20% maintenance price increase from May 2020 to August 2020. The company is actively managing its spending and will continue to invest in critical areas such as R&D, construction, and digitizing the company to ensure future success. The impact of COVID-19 on Autodesk's business in fiscal 2022 and beyond will depend on several factors, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, actions taken by governments and businesses, and the speed and timing of economic recovery. The company's net revenue by income statement presentation includes subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, and other revenue. Its product offerings are focused on architecture, engineering and construction, autocad and autocad lt, manufacturing, and media and entertainment. Autodesk's future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by changes in tax laws and accounting for uncertain tax positions, among other factors.

Revenues
Autodesk, a software company, reported total net revenue of $3.79 billion during fiscal 2021, which is a 16% increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Recurring revenue accounted for 97% of net revenue during the fiscal year ending on January 31, 2021. The net revenue retention rate was within the range of 100% and 110% as of January 31, 2021, and within the range of 110% and 120% as of January 31, 2020. Deferred revenue was $3.36 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior fiscal year, while remaining performance obligations were $4.24 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to a 26% increase in subscription revenue, partially offset by a 53% decrease in maintenance revenue. Autodesk relies significantly upon major distributors and resellers, including Tech Data and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 37% and 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue during fiscal 2021, respectively. The company believes that resellers and end-users would be able to continue purchasing its products through other distributors without substantial disruption to its revenue if any of its agreements with Tech Data or Ingram Micro were terminated. Autodesk uses several key performance metrics, including recurring revenue and NR3, to monitor the strength of its recurring business. It generates a significant amount of its revenue in the US, Japan, Germany, Finland, and the UK, and uses foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. At January 31, 2021, the company had $1,857.2 million in cash and marketable securities, while its cash flow from operations increased to $1,437.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, from $1,415.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The company repurchased 2.6 million shares of its common stock for $549.4 million during fiscal 2021, compared to 2.7 million shares of its common stock for $455.5 million during fiscal 2020.

Liquidity
Autodesk's primary source of cash is from the sale of its software and related services, while its primary use of cash is for operating costs such as employee-related expenses, marketing, facilities, and overhead costs. The company anticipates long-term cash requirements for acquisitions, debt repayments, common stock repurchases, and capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2021, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.86 billion and net accounts receivable of $643.1 million. The company's primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup, and it has no outstanding borrowings on its credit facility as of March 19, 2021. Autodesk expects to meet its liquidity needs through current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings. The company's revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which it has put in place foreign currency contracts as part of its risk management strategy. Autodesk believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Debt
As of January 31, 2021, the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. The company provided a table summarizing its significant financial contractual obligations and their expected effect on liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Purchase orders or contracts for supplies and other goods and services were not included in the table, as the company could not determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represented contractual obligations. The company did not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods that exceeded expected requirements for three months. The company had certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. The company provided indemnifications and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties, but could not estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on future results of operations due to highly variable potential costs.
