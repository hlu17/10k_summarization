Results of Operations
The text presents two tables that summarize the financial data of a company. The first table shows the historical consolidated statements of operations data for specific periods, while the second table presents the components of the consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for the same periods.

Revenues
The company generates revenue through three main sources: create solutions, operate solutions, and strategic partnerships and other. Create solutions revenue is primarily generated through subscription fee arrangements for the use of products and related support services, with additional revenue from professional services. Operate solutions revenue is generated through revenue-share and usage-based business models, primarily through monetization products that facilitate transactions through a unified auction. The company also provides cloud-based services for application hosting and end-user engagement, as well as voice chat services. Strategic partnerships revenue is generated through multi-year software development contracts and royalties based on sales of applications sold on partner platforms. The company saw revenue growth in 2020, primarily driven by create and operate solutions, with a $25 million increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, strategic partnership revenue decreased due to deal delays and retirement of certain partners' product offerings. The company expects its operate solutions beyond monetization, including cloud operations and hosting services, to grow as a percentage of revenue in the long term.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenue for a company includes hosting expenses, personnel costs, allocated overhead, third party fees, and amortization and depreciation. Gross profit, or revenue minus cost of revenue, is affected by factors such as product mix and hosting costs. The company expects an increase in gross profit in absolute dollars, but gross margin may fluctuate. In 2020, the cost of revenue increased due to higher hosting and personnel-related expenses to support growth in create solutions and strategic partnerships. Headcount also increased, and there was a one-time stock-based compensation expense related to the IPO.

Operating Income
The operating expenses of the company consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, with personnel-related costs being the most significant component. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating expenses by approximately $40 million in 2020 due to reduced travel and spending on events and facilities, but this is unlikely to be repeated in future years. Research and development expenses are expected to increase as the company expands its teams to develop new products and enter new markets. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase as the company hires additional personnel, invests in additional tools and technologies, and continues to build brand awareness. General and administrative expenses are expected to increase as the company scales to support the growth of its business. The company uses non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP loss from operations to evaluate its financial performance, which exclude certain expenses such as stock-based compensation, employer tax related to employee stock transactions, and non-cash charitable contribution expenses. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial statements.

Interest Expense
The text discusses the interest expense and interest income of a company. The interest expense is mainly associated with their credit agreement and was recognized in 2020 on the outstanding balance of their $125 million credit facility. The company had no outstanding debt in 2019. The interest income and other expenses are primarily from interest earned on their cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, amortization of premium arising at the acquisition of marketable securities, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The company's exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased as they have expanded their global operations. The interest income and other expense for the year 2020 increased mainly due to foreign currency remeasurement losses and lower returns on their interest-bearing deposits resulting from lower interest rates.

Liquidity
The company has primarily financed its operations through the sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock, as well as payments received from customers using its platform. As of December 31, 2020, the company had $1.75 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily held for working capital purposes. The company has generated losses from its operations since inception, with an accumulated deficit of $797.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The company expects to continue to incur operating losses due to investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. The company may require additional capital to execute its strategic initiatives to grow its business. The company believes its existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, but its future capital requirements will depend on growth rate, timing and extent of spending, capital expenditures, expansion of sales and marketing, and continued need to invest in IT infrastructure. The company may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than anticipated, and if unable to raise additional capital, its business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. The company's changes in cash flows were primarily due to strong performance within its operate solutions and savings in operational expenses due to COVID-19. The company expects its free cash flow to remain volatile from quarter to quarter and likely to decline in 2021. The company's cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to its initial public offering, issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, and revolving loan facility, while net cash outflows from financing activities were due to repayment of principal on its revolving loan facility. The company's cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to non-cash charges, while cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. Historical cash flows are not necessarily indicative of the company's results in any future period.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, the company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements or held any significant variable interest entities. The company's contractual obligations as of that date are summarized in a table, which includes primarily operating lease obligations for real estate and purchase commitments related to data center hosting providers. However, the table does not include amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, as the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities cannot be reliably predicted.
