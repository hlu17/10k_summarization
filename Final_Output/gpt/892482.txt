Revenues
Qumu Corporation generates revenue by selling enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. The company's software sales include perpetual software licenses, cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS), and term software licenses. Service revenue includes SaaS, term software licenses, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Qumu's revenues vary based on the type of contract entered into with each customer. The increase in total revenues from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by a large customer order due to the change in working environment caused by COVID-19. The increase in service revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to an increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues, and professional services revenues. The increase in service revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues and professional services revenues, and the decrease in software licenses and appliances revenues was due to a decrease in perpetual software license and appliance sales. Future consolidated revenues will depend on factors such as the adoption rate of Qumu's software solutions, the type of licenses offered, timing of customer orders and renewals, the product and service mix of customer orders, economic conditions, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Gross Profit Margin
The text provides a comparison of gross profit and gross margin by revenue category for the years ended December 31, 2018 to 2020, with gross margins inclusive of the impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. The company's service personnel decreased from 2018 to 2020. Gross margin percentages decreased in total in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in service gross margin due to lower term license revenue and outsourced professional services expenses for certain customer-specific projects. The 2019 gross margin improvement was driven by an increase in term software license revenue, decreased amortization expense, and lower royalty expense. Future gross profit margins will fluctuate quarter to quarter and will be impacted by the company's expansion into new market opportunities, growth and mix of product and service offerings, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The cost of software licenses and appliances revenues in 2021 is expected to include approximately $0.1 million of amortization expense for purchased intangibles.

Operating Income
Operating expenses for Qumu Corporation increased by 19% in 2020 compared to 2019, reaching 96.4% of revenues. The increase was driven by one-time transaction expenses associated with the company's terminated merger with Synacor and non-cash office lease charges resulting from the adoption of the company's remote work policy. Severance expenses relating to cost reduction initiatives and personnel transitions also contributed to the increase. Research and development expenses represented 28% of revenues in 2020 and increased by $892,000 compared to 2019, primarily due to increased costs related to personnel and projects to support customers' increased usage of Qumu's cloud-based enterprise video solution due to Covid-19. Sales and marketing expenses represented 31% of revenues in 2020 and increased by $346,000 compared to 2019 due to increased costs for outside services and consulting associated with the implementation of the company's strategic plan, higher compensation costs, and increased commissions expense. General and administrative expenses represented 35% of revenues in 2020 and increased by $3.3 million compared to 2019 due to transaction-related expenses related to the company's merger agreement and subsequent termination with Synacor, non-cash charges resulting from the adoption of the company's remote work policy, and severance costs incurred with the departure of the company's CEO. Operating expenses in 2021 are expected to include approximately $0.7 million of amortization expense associated with purchased intangibles.

Liquidity
The company's liquidity and capital resources are presented in a table, showing that it expects to maintain operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months through cash flows from operations, cash reserves, and additional resources. The company had negative working capital of $2.9 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors. The company's primary source of cash from operating activities is sales of products and services to customers, while its primary use of cash is for personnel costs, outside service providers, royalty payments, and equipment purchases. The company's international subsidiaries hold $1.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, which can be repatriated without an adverse tax impact. Net cash provided from operating activities was $1.6 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1.5 million in 2019. Net cash used in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment totaled $128,000 in 2020. Financing activities used net cash of $120,000 in 2020, primarily due to principal payments on finance leases and other financing obligations, offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. The company has a common stock repurchase program, but it did not repurchase any shares in 2020, 2019, or 2018, and it did not declare or pay any dividends during those years.

Debt
The company has several non-cancellable operating leases for office space and finance leases for IT equipment that expire over the next three years. The company recognizes a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date and measures the lease liability at present value. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, adjusted for lease payments, direct costs, and lease incentives. Lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the useful life or lease term. The company determines the discount rate, lease term, and lease payments as key estimates and judgments. Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized as ROU assets and lease liabilities. The company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of contracts and estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The company transitioned to permanent remote work, surrendering its right to occupy office space and closing three of its four offices. The company recorded a non-cash expense related to the ROU assets and incurred a non-cash expense related to surrendering leasehold improvements and equipment. The company entered into lease agreements for flexible shared workspace arrangements, recognizing lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The company intends to continue paying rental payments due pursuant to the leases. The company issued two warrants for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,239,286 shares of common stock, accounting for them as current liabilities based on their characteristics and provisions. The warrants are revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until exercised or expired, and the fair value is estimated using option pricing models based on the company's stock price, volatility, expected life, and risk-free interest rate. Changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value of each warrant.
