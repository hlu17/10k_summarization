Results of Operations
The company's services are sold on a subscription basis, with historically one to five-year contract terms billed annually, but they are increasingly moving towards monthly billing. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription once service commences. The company grows by signing new customers to subscription services, upselling existing customers, and retaining existing customers through renewal of their subscriptions for successive periods. Backlog is the total order value of contracted business that has not yet been recognized into revenue. The backlog will grow if the value of total orders added in a period exceeds the value of revenue recognized in that period, and will decline if revenue recognized exceeds the total order value added for the period. As of December 31, 2020, the company's net dollar customer retention percentage was 100%. The company monitors annual recurring revenue (ARR) to determine to what extent individual customer relationships are growing or declining. The company's future growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of their products and services.

Revenues
The table provided shows a comparison of total revenues for the years 2018 to 2020. In 2019, there was a significant increase of $103 million or 146% in revenue compared to the previous year, primarily due to the acquisition of the appriver business, which contributed $97.8 million to the year-end revenue. In 2020, there was an increase of $45.1 million or 26% in revenue, partly due to the recognition of twelve full months of sales for the appriver business. The company has seen growth in revenue through its subscription-based business model, with steady additions to the subscriber base and a high rate of existing customer renewals. The company's revenue is categorized by industry verticals, with healthcare and financial services being the top two industries. The company also has a wide base of distributors, with approximately 76% and 74% of new business in 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting from partner relationships. The company expects continued growth in 2021 through existing and new products and increased sales from partner channels. The company also measures the health of its subscriber base through annual recurring revenue (ARR), which aids in determining customer relationship growth or decline.

Gross Profit Margin
The table compares the cost of revenue and selling and marketing expenses for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The cost of revenue is mainly associated with Microsoft fees related to the resale of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products, zixdata center's operation and maintenance costs, third-party data center costs, field deployment team, customer service and support, and depreciation expense of computer equipment and amortization of acquired technology. The increase in cost of revenue from $25.8 million in 2018 to $87.6 million in 2019 was due to the acquisition of AppRiver, and the continued sales of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products. The increase in cost of revenue from $87.6 million in 2019 to $123.5 million in 2020 was primarily due to sales of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products. The selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of salary, commissions, travel, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, promotional activities, and advertising. The increase in selling and marketing expenses from $20.4 million in 2018 to $55 million in 2019 was due to the AppRiver acquisition and related integration activities, increased headcount expense, and spending on marketing programs. The increase in selling and marketing expenses from $55 million in 2019 to $56.6 million in 2020 was primarily due to increases in commissions and headcount expense, offset by COVID-19 related reductions in travel and advertising expenditures and decreases in integration-related spending.

Liquidity
The company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and availability under its $25 million revolving facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its operations for at least the next twelve months. The company plans for and measures its liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process and quarterly reviews, and it will continue to monitor its position to protect itself against uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis. The company's primary source of liquidity from operations is the collection of revenue in advance from customers, accounts receivable from customers, and the management of the timing of payments to vendors and service providers. The company's investing activities in 2020 included $30.0 million, net of cash acquired, used in the acquisition of CloudAlly and $18.0 million for capital expenditures. Financing activities in 2020 included proceeds from long-term debt of $30.4 million, net of issuance costs of $653 thousand, and repayment of $9.9 million in debt.

Debt
On February 20, 2019, a credit agreement was entered into by the company with a syndicate of lenders and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, providing for borrowing in the form of a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million, a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility of $10 million, and a senior secured revolving credit facility of $25 million. The term loan was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the AppRiver acquisition, while the delayed draw term loan facility was borrowed in full to pay a portion of the purchase price related to the DeliverySlip acquisition. On November 5, 2020, the company borrowed an incremental $35 million term loan, which was used to fund the acquisition of CloudAlly and to repay all existing borrowing under the revolving facility. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of Zix and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and guaranteed by substantially all of Zix's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The company also has severance agreements with certain employees that would require it to pay up to approximately $5.3 million if all such employees were terminated from employment after a triggering event as defined in the severance agreements.
