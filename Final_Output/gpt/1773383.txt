Results of Operations
Dynatrace, a software intelligence company, reported that its subscription revenue increased to 93% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021, compared to 89% in the prior year. License revenue decreased by 89%, primarily due to declining sales of classic products to existing customers as they convert to the company's Dynatrace platform. Service revenue increased by 3%. The cost of subscription revenue increased by 6%, primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the growth of the company's subscription cloud-based offering and cloud-based hosting costs. Operating expenses decreased for research and development by 7%, sales and marketing by 8%, and general and administrative by 43%. The company's subscription gross profit increased by 39%, while license gross profit decreased by 89%, and service gross profit increased by 99%.

Revenues
Dynatrace's revenue is derived from subscriptions, licenses, and services. Subscription revenue includes SaaS agreements, term-based licenses, perpetual licenses, and maintenance and support agreements. Dynatrace typically invoices subscription fees and term licenses annually in advance and recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. License revenue comes from sales of perpetual and term-based licenses of classic products sold only to existing customers. The license fee portion of classic perpetual license arrangements is recognized upfront. Service revenue is derived from helping customers deploy software and training personnel, and is recognized on a time and materials basis as services are delivered. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is defined as the daily revenue of all active subscription agreements multiplied by 365, excluding month-to-month agreements and product usage overage billings. As of March 31, 2021, Dynatrace's total ARR was $774 million, a 35% increase over the previous year. Dynatrace aims to increase subscription revenue as a key strategic priority.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of subscription revenue includes all direct costs to deliver and support subscription products, such as salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, and related expenses. The cost of service revenue includes salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, and related expenses for the services organization, along with allocated overhead for depreciation of equipment, facilities, and IT. Amortization of acquired technology includes amortization expense for technology acquired in business combinations and the Thoma Bravo funds' acquisition of the company in 2014. Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit is affected by factors such as the mix of license, subscription, and services revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which the customer support and services organizations expand. Gross margin is expected to fluctuate from period to period depending on these various factors.

Operating Income
The text discusses the various components of the operating expenses of a company, including personnel costs, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, amortization of other intangibles, and restructuring and other expenses. Personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation, are the most significant component of operating expenses. Research and development expenses primarily consist of the cost of programming personnel and are focused on developing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs, commissions earned by sales personnel, and the cost of marketing and business development programs. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs for executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, and other corporate expenses. Amortization of other intangibles primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships and capitalized software and tradenames. Restructuring and other expenses primarily consist of various restructuring activities undertaken to achieve strategic and financial objectives, including product offering cancellations, termination of related employees, office relocation, administrative cost of structure realignment, and consolidation of resources. 

The text also discusses the cash flows from operating activities for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. For the year ended March 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million due to net income of $75.7 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $113.6 million and a change of $31.2 million in operating assets and liabilities. For the year ended March 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $142.5 million due to a net loss of $413.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $248.7 million and a change of $22.7 million in operating assets and liabilities. For the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $147.1 million due to a net loss of $116.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $115.9 million and a change of $147.4 million in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued expenses, and decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts receivable, which were offset by an increase in deferred commissions.

Liquidity
As of March 31, 2021, the company had $325.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $44.4 million available under its revolving credit facility. The company has financed its operations primarily through payments by customers for use of its product offerings and related services and, to a lesser extent, the net proceeds received from sales of equity securities and borrowings on its term loan facilities. The company completed its IPO in August 2019, issuing and selling an aggregate of 38.9 million shares of common stock at $16.00 per share, and received aggregate net proceeds of $585.3 million from the IPO. The company's historical expansion with customers has typically been achieved by executing additional contracts, each with unique pricing and anniversary dates, but it is transitioning to a program that combines these contracts into one single, often multi-year contract per customer with one single anniversary date. Cash flows from customer collections have increased over the past three years, but operating expenses have also increased as the company has invested in growing its business. The company's operating cash requirements may increase in the future as it continues to invest in the strategic growth of its company. The company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment balances, funds available under its debt agreement, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. The company's future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including its growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, seasonality of its billing activities, timing and extent of spending to support its growth strategy, and the continued market acceptance of its products. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021, was $97.8 million, primarily as a result of repayments of the company's term loans. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2021, was $13.9 million, as a result of the purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software additions.

Debt
The text states that the company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and has various obligations to make future cash payments, including long-term debt agreements, rent payments, and interest obligations on term loans. The estimated future interest payments on the first lien term loan are based on the interest rate effective on March 31, 2021, and the principal outstanding on that date was $401.1 million. As of March 31, 2021, the company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, $15.6 million of letters of credit outstanding, and $44.4 million available for borrowing. The company had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, which are not reflected in the table above. All of the company's obligations under its term loans are guaranteed by its existing and future domestic subsidiaries and secured by a security interest in substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets. As of March 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants pertaining to the first lien credit agreement. Further details about the company's credit facilities are available in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report.
