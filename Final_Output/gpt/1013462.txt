Business Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on Ansys' business and employees, and the company has taken action to enable remote work, closed offices, and implemented travel restrictions. The pandemic has disrupted the business of Ansys' customers and partners and impacted its consolidated results of operations. The company is adjusting spending to reflect the pace of economic recovery while continuing to invest in acquisitions, R&D, and digital transformation projects critical to operating efficiently and scaling the business for future growth. Ansys' GAAP and non-GAAP results for 2020 show an increase in revenue due to growth in lease licenses, maintenance and service revenue, and contributions from recent acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue. The company's financial position includes $913.2 million in cash and short-term investments, and working capital of $990.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers, and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia. The company's strategy of pervasive engineering simulation seeks to deepen the use of simulation in its core, inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle, and embed simulation into its partners' ecosystems.

Results of Operations
The table provided in the text shows consolidated financial data for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018. The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by 10.9%, while revenue grew by 9.8% in constant currency. Lease license revenue increased by 23.2%, and maintenance revenue grew by 10.5%. Service revenue increased by 7.5%, while perpetual license revenue decreased by 4.4%. The company experienced increased interest in enterprise agreements involving time-based licenses. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the company's revenue, resulting in the cancellation of in-person events and delays in closing certain transactions. The company expects a recovery in the business environment as reliable vaccines become more available. The net increase in cost of sales and operating expenses was mainly due to increased salaries and other headcount-related costs, increased third-party technical support, increased stock-based compensation, and consulting costs. The net increase in selling, general and administrative costs was due to increased salaries, incentive compensation, and other headcount-related costs, increased stock-based compensation, increased third-party commissions, and increased bad debt expense due to expected losses related to COVID-19. The increase in research and development costs was due to increased salaries and other headcount-related costs and increased stock-based compensation. The company's net income and diluted earnings per share increased in 2020.

Revenues
ACV reported a 17.2% increase in revenue for 2019 compared to 2018, or a 19% increase in constant currency. The growth was driven by investments in global sales, support and marketing, and the contribution of 2019 and 2018 acquisitions, which added $72.9m in incremental revenue. Lease license revenue increased 47.3%, annual maintenance contracts grew 12.4%, and service revenue increased 39.1%. However, perpetual license revenue decreased 2.5%. The stronger US dollar impacted international and domestic revenues negatively. ACV applied fair value provisions to acquired deferred revenue, resulting in a reduction of post-acquisition revenue. The company experienced an increase in operating expenses, primarily due to increased salaries, incentive compensation, and other headcount-related costs. Interest income increased, but interest expense also increased due to debt financing obtained in FY 2019. The effective tax rate decreased due to benefits related to the release of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and transition tax recorded in 2019. Net income increased for the year.

Operating Income
The company provides non-GAAP financial measures, including revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, to evaluate its performance relative to competitors, set targets and budgets, allocate resources, measure profitability and forecasting accuracy, assess financial discipline, and determine variable compensation. These measures exclude certain items and are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, but a detailed explanation and reconciliation to GAAP measures are provided. The company believes these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, but acknowledges limitations in comparability to GAAP measures and potential differences in calculation methods used by competitors. The company compensates for these limitations by using non-GAAP measures as supplements to GAAP measures and reviewing reconciliations.

Liquidity
The text discusses the financial activities and performance of a company during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to 2019 due to increased net income and increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities. However, longer-term payment requests related to larger contract commitments have been experienced as the COVID-19 crisis lengthens. Net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 due to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays and decreased capital expenditures. In contrast, net cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2019 related to the LST acquisition being repaid. The company plans to spend $30-40 million on capital expenditures during fiscal year 2021 depending on various factors, including the impact of COVID-19. The company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to a revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. In the past, and in the future, the company may repurchase stock to offset dilution and return capital to stockholders.
