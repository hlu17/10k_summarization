Business Overview
When a business is acquired, the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, liabilities, deferred revenue, and identifiable intangible assets. If there is any residual purchase price, it is recorded as goodwill. Estimations and judgments are made to determine the fair value of these assets and liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill, based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, assessment of this information, and historical experience. These estimates are uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and circumstances may affect their accuracy or validity, requiring adjustments to the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities. Cadence offers software, hardware, services, and reusable IC design blocks to enable customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets. The company completed acquisitions of AWR and Integrand, which increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, more than revenue during fiscal 2020. Cadence has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of Belgium-based Numeca, a leader in CFD, mesh generation, multi-physics simulation, and optimization, which supports the company's intelligent system design strategy. Management uses revenue, certain elements of operating expenses, and cash flow from operations as performance indicators to manage the business.

Results of Operations
The text discusses the fiscal 2020 consolidated results of operations and compares them to fiscal 2019 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes, and cash flows. Fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, resulting in additional revenue of approximately $45 million and additional expense of approximately $35 million. The results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 show increased product and maintenance revenue, higher selling costs, continued investment in research and development, decreased operating expenses due to COVID-19, a 3 percentage point increase in operating margin, and changes in provision for income taxes due to non-cash tax benefits resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to the Irish subsidiary during fiscal 2019. The discussion of fiscal 2019 changes compared to fiscal 2018 can be found in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.

Revenues
The company generates revenue primarily through licensing software and IP, selling or leasing emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for software, hardware, and IP, providing engineering services, and earning royalties from the use of their IP. About 85-90% of their annual revenue is recurring revenue, recognized over time from software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. The remaining revenue is up-front revenue, primarily generated by sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. Revenue by product category fluctuates based on demand for products and services, available resources, and ability to deliver and support them. Revenue in the United States and China increased in fiscal year 2020, with an increase in demand from customers in China resulting in approximately 17% of their revenue being generated from customers in China. However, trade restrictions may impact revenue from certain customers in China. Most of their revenue is transacted in USD, but certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.

Gross Profit Margin
The table provided shows the cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. The cost of product and maintenance includes expenses associated with the sale and lease of hardware, licensing of software and IP products, employee salary and benefits, customer support services, amortization of acquired intangibles, technical documentation costs, and royalties payable to third-party vendors. The cost of product and maintenance is primarily dependent on hardware product sales, but also impacted by employee-related costs, inventory reserves, and the acquisition of intangible assets. The cost of product and maintenance increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to 2019 due to increased demand for hardware, inventory reserves, and the mix of revenue-generating products. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased in fiscal year 2020 due to assets acquired from AWR and Integrand and in-process technology being placed into service. Cost of services primarily includes employee-related costs for revenue-generating projects and infrastructure maintenance. Despite an increase in services revenue, cost of services decreased in fiscal year 2020 due to higher margins and temporary savings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Operating Income
The company's operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses, which can fluctuate due to various factors such as changes in employee numbers, stock-based compensation, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, and variable compensation programs. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreased operating expenses for travel, meetings, and events in fiscal 2020. The company's operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies, and changes in foreign exchange rates can affect the company's consolidated financial statements. In fiscal 2020, salary, benefits, and other employee-related costs included in marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation. However, reduced costs for marketing events and travel due to COVID-19 partially offset these increases.

Interest Expense
The interest expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is broken down into two categories. In fiscal 2020, interest expense increased due to the borrowing of $350 million under their revolving credit facility during the first quarter as a precautionary measure in response to global economic uncertainty. All outstanding borrowings were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For more information on their debt arrangements, including their revolving credit facility, see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity
Cadence Design Systems, a software company specializing in electronic design, reported on its cash flows and financial activities in fiscal 2020 and 2019. Cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to improved operational results and timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations and purchases of property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments. Cash used for financing activities decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements. As of January 2, 2021, Cadence had $928.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, with approximately 61% held by foreign subsidiaries. The company expects its current cash balances, cash flows from operations, and available credit to be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Cadence also has a stock repurchase program and a revolving credit facility with no outstanding loans as of January 2, 2021. The company issued senior notes in 2014 and was in compliance with all associated covenants as of January 2, 2021.

Debt
The company reported that as of January 2, 2021, they did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Regulation S-K. They also disclosed that they have long-term income tax liabilities of $17.6 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. The majority of this liability is expected to be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years, with smaller portions payable within 3 to 5 years and more than 5 years. The remaining portion of their long-term contractual obligations is primarily associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.
