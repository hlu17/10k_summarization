Business Overview
Xperi Corporation is a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company and one of the industry's largest intellectual property (IP) licensing platforms. The company invents, develops and delivers technologies that enable extraordinary experiences. Xperi technologies are delivered via their brands, including DTS, HD Radio, IMAX Enhanced, Invensas, TiVo, and by their subsidiary, Perceive Corporation. The company has more than 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide, and their technologies are integrated into billions of consumer devices, media platforms, and semiconductors worldwide. The fair value valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination under ASC 805 requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, with critical estimates including future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and acquired developed technologies and patents; competitive trends and market comparables; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in their product portfolio; and discount rates. On December 18, 2019, Xperi entered into a definitive agreement with TiVo to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction, with Xperi determined to be the accounting acquirer in the mergers. As a result, the historical financial statements of Xperi for periods prior to the mergers are considered to be the historical financial statements of Xperi Holding Corporation, with their results of operations including the operations of TiVo after June 1, 2020. The company is currently contemplating and may pursue, subject to any required regulatory approvals, a separation of their product business and IP licensing business through a tax-efficient transaction, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. The company is evaluating the optimal timing of the contemplated business separation and currently anticipates that such separation will not be completed earlier than the first half of 2022.

Results of Operations
The text discusses the financial impacts of significant events that have occurred over the past three years, which affect the comparability of financial statements. The company generates revenue through two business segments: product segment and IP licensing segment. The company licenses its audio, digital radio, imaging, edge-based machine learning, and multi-channel video user experience solutions under three revenue models: fixed-fee media IP licensing, fixed-fee or minimum guarantee semiconductor IP or product licensing, and per-unit or per-subscriber royalty licenses. The revenue recognition varies based on the type of license agreement, and the company actively monitors and enforces its IP. Additionally, the company has arrangements with multiple system operators for the TiVo service, subscription services, and TiVo-enabled DVRs and non-DVRs. The company's total revenue increased significantly in 2020 due to the inclusion of revenue from TiVo operations following mergers and semiconductor IP agreements executed during the first two quarters of 2020. Xperi has entered into a patent license agreement with Comcast, effective from the expiration of their prior agreement in 2016 until 2031. The agreement resulted in Xperi recording revenue for past royalties in Q4 2020 and expecting revenue from the license until 2031. Cost of licensing, services, and software revenue increased by $49.2m YoY in 2020 due to the inclusion of $49.0m of TiVo expenses since the mergers, and is expected to continue increasing in 2021. Research, development, and other related costs increased by $84.3m YoY in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of post-merger TiVo R&D expenses, increased headcount, and personnel costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $127.7m YoY in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TiVo expenses, merger-related transaction costs, severance and retention costs, and costs associated with the contemplated separation of Xperi's business. Xperi has two reportable segments: product and IP licensing, and unallocated operating expenses consist primarily of selling, marketing, general, and administrative expenses.

Revenues
The text discusses the financial performance of Xperi Corporation in 2020 compared to the previous year. The company reported an increase in revenue primarily due to the inclusion of TiVo revenue and higher minimum guarantee revenue from contract renewals. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in per-unit royalty revenue due to the impact of COVID-19. Operating expenses also increased due to the inclusion of TiVo product expenses and increased headcount and personnel costs. Xperi expects research and development expenses to remain significant as new products and solutions are developed, and a full year of TiVo R&D expenses will be included in 2021. Operating income increased from $11.6 million in 2019 to $24.2 million in 2020. In terms of TiVo's financial performance, revenue increased primarily due to post-merger IP licensing revenue and semiconductor IP agreements. Operating expenses increased due to TiVo IP licensing expenses and significant amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the mergers. Xperi expects litigation expenses to continue to be a material portion of its operating expenses, fluctuating between periods due to planned or ongoing litigation related to intellectual property and contract rights. TiVo's litigation expenses were significantly higher than Xperi's in 2019 and 2020. Operating income for TiVo was $402.6 million in 2020, compared to $37.4 million in 2019.

Liquidity
Xperi's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are its operating cash flows and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $257.1 million, an increase of $135.6 million from the previous year. This increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations, net long-term debt proceeds received, and cash acquired from TiVo as a result of mergers. The company's investment activities aim to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while capturing a market rate of return. Xperi maintains a diversified portfolio of securities, including money market funds and debt securities. The company repurchased $70.1 million in common stock and paid quarterly dividends in 2020. Xperi believes its cash from operations, together with cash, cash equivalents, and investments currently available, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt service, dividends, stock repurchases, and acquisition needs for at least the next 12 months. However, poor financial results or unexpected expenses could give rise to additional financing requirements.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. The company's contractual obligations as of that date were as follows: (1) under the debt agreement, additional principal cash payments must be made on an annual basis beginning March 31, 2022 based on certain leverage ratios and excess cash flow generated for the immediately preceding fiscal year; (2) under the debt agreement, the company's debt bears a variable interest rate; (3) amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with purchase obligations to service providers, including the payments due within the next 12 months; and (4) operating leases are presented on a gross basis. The company may also be obligated to make certain contingent or variable payments over an estimated period of approximately four years if certain conditions are met or milestones are achieved. As of December 31, 2020, the company had accrued $94.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits in long-term income taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions, which includes $2.5 million of accrued interest and penalties. The company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. If the company receives its South Korean withholding tax refund of $123.0 million, net of interest income and foreign exchange loss, then $62.3 million of unrecognized tax benefit would be payable to the US tax authorities. These amounts have not been included in the table of contractual obligations.
