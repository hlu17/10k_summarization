Business Overview
On June 27, 2018, RocketFuel Blockchain Company (RBC) and B4MC Gold Mines completed the business combination, in which the sellers transferred all their right, title and interest in RBC to B4MC, making RBC a wholly owned subsidiary of B4MC. B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. in September 2018. The company provides check-out and payment systems that automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems increase customers' data protection and enable them to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing their spending credentials, such as credit card data. The company also offers a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant and a customer portal where shoppers can track their payments and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. The RocketFuel payment solution utilizes a variety of blockchains in its execution, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company plans to add connectivity to Binance, Kraken, Gemini and other exchanges to pay directly from bank accounts. The RocketFuel check-out systems are designed to operate identically across merchant channels with all participating merchants; ecommerce merchants are able to encode their check-out protocol to support the technology and will no longer have to administer complex check-out and payment gateways at their ecommerce websites. The company's corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.

Results of Operations
The company generated $10,000 in revenue during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, from a one-year contract with a customer for the implementation of their blockchain technology. The contract also provided for transaction processing using their technology with no fees during the contract term. The revenue was recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized over the contract term. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the company did not generate any revenue. They expect future revenue to come from fees charged for implementing their blockchain technology and transactional fees earned from their merchant customers. Research and development expenses increased by $160,015 due to the engagement of contract developers and the hiring of a full-time Chief Technology Officer. General and administrative expenses increased by $2,078,528 primarily due to legal fees and payroll expenses related to hiring a full-time Chief Executive Officer, as well as stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, amounted to $1,622,335, including the issuance of common stock, stock options, and warrants.

Liquidity
As of March 31, 2021, the company had a cash balance of $800,331, which is an increase of $792,493 compared to the same period in the previous year. However, the company has a current cash requirement of approximately $200,000 per month. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the company used net cash of $636,257 for operating activities, which was primarily due to its net loss of $2,363,582, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and related party payable. The company provided net cash of $1,428,750 from financing activities during the same period, mainly from the issuance of common stock to two investors. The financial statements have been presented on the basis that the company is a going concern, but management believes that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to its net loss and cash flows used in operating activities. The company will require additional financing to continue developing its product and executing its business plan, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful in raising the necessary capital. If the company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of its operations or business development activities. As of March 31, 2021, the company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
