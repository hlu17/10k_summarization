Business Overview
Pluralsight is a technology workforce development platform that offers high-quality learning experiences delivered by subject-matter experts. The platform empowers teams to keep up with the pace of technological change and boosts productivity. Pluralsight started operations in 2004 and shifted entirely to an online delivery model in 2011. They expanded their platform both organically through internal initiatives and through acquisitions, which have been focused on adding content and capabilities to their offerings. Pluralsight Flow, formerly known as GitPrime, measures software developer productivity and enables technology leaders to enhance skills and drive productivity by identifying talent and areas of improvement within their teams. Pluralsight derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of subscriptions to its platform, primarily to business customers through its direct sales team and website. Pluralsight achieved significant growth in recent periods and had revenue of $391.9 million in 2020. Pluralsight has a strong dollar-based net retention rate, which measures their ability to retain and expand revenue generated from existing business customers. Pluralsight entered into an agreement and plan of merger in December 2020 with Pluralsight Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the company, and affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Fund VII, L.P.

Revenues
The company derives most of its revenue from selling subscriptions to its platform, which are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the subscription period. Subscription terms range from one month to three years, and most subscriptions to business customers are billed annually. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $391.9 million, a 24% increase from the previous year, primarily due to increased sales to new and existing business customers, as well as an increase in revenue from individual customers. The company also generates revenue from professional services such as consulting, integration, and training.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of revenue for an online learning platform includes direct costs such as author and instructor fees, content library amortization, hosting and delivery fees, employee-related costs, and third-party transcription costs. Gross profit and gross margin are affected by various factors such as subscription mix, author fees, hosting costs, and customer support expansion. While gross margin is expected to increase in the long term due to a decrease in author fees, it may fluctuate in the short term. In 2020, cost of revenue increased by $11.2 million, primarily due to employee compensation costs, intangible asset amortization, author fees, hosting and delivery costs, and software development depreciation. Gross profit increased by $63.8 million, mainly due to revenue growth, and gross margin increased from 77% to 79% due to a decrease in author fees. Operating expenses, including sales and marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative expenses, increased in 2020 due to employee compensation costs and acquisition-related costs. Interest expense increased due to debt issued in March 2019, and other income decreased due to decreased market interest rates.

Operating Income
The operating expenses of the company are divided into three categories: sales and marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative. The largest component of each category is employee-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation expense, and employee benefits. Shared overhead costs are allocated based on headcount in each category. Sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of employee compensation costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions, equity-based compensation expense, and allocated overhead costs. The increases in sales and marketing expenses were driven primarily by increased employee compensation costs, marketing and event-related costs, and increased headcount. Technology and content costs consist mainly of research and development activities, including personnel costs, consulting services, other platform development costs, and allocated overhead costs. Content costs consist of personnel costs and other activities associated with content development, course production, curriculum direction, and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, people operations, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and equity-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting, and other consulting services; and allocated overhead costs. The increases in general and administrative expenses were driven primarily by increased employee compensation costs, organizational structure, and operating as a public company. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $9.1 million, primarily due to a net loss, equity-based compensation, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities. The company monitors key business metrics to evaluate its business, identify trends, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.

Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, the principal sources of liquidity for the company were cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments totaling $503.7 million, which were held for working capital purposes. The company's cash equivalents and investments primarily consisted of highly liquid investments in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities. The company has financed its operations primarily through sales of equity securities, long-term debt facilities, and net cash provided by operating activities. The company's free cash flow was negative in 2020 due to continued investments to support business growth, but the company expects to continue such investments to sustain growth. The company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments, as well as projected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, and if it is unable to raise additional capital when desired, its business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. The company is obligated to pass along some of its tax benefits and cash flows by making future payments to certain tax receivable agreement (TRA) members, which could reduce overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to the company. The company has not made any payments under the TRA to date and does not expect to make payments in the near future. The company's cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were primarily due to financing and investing activities, including proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net proceeds from the issuance of notes, and purchases of investments, property, and equipment, and content library.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, there were no relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. The company's principal commitments and contractual obligations consist of obligations under leases for office facilities. The table provided summarizes non-cancellable contractual obligations associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Purchase orders and obligations that can be cancelled without significant penalty are not included in the table. The company has entered into indemnification agreements with directors, executive officers, and other officers, which will require the company to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. However, no demands have been made upon the company to provide indemnification under such agreements, and there are no claims that could materially affect the company's consolidated financial statements.
