Results of Operations
The consolidated revenue and operating results for fiscal 2021 and 2020 are presented, showing a decrease in total revenue of $23.6 million, or 14.7%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions caused by COVID-19 uncertainty. However, support, maintenance, and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue. Gross profit increased by $8.4 million, or 10.4%, with a total gross profit margin of 65.2%. Operating expenses increased $16.8 million, or 18.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, with product development increasing by $13.9 million, or 33.5%. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020, while fiscal 2019 had no impairments. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.

Revenues
The company presents their revenue in their consolidated statements of operations as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue, or professional services revenue, as required by the SEC. They caution that their terminology and definitions for revenue may differ from those used by other companies, and comparing financial measures to those of other companies should be done carefully. They use terms such as "24" to describe revenue.

Liquidity
The cash requirements of the company consist mainly of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and operating expenses including payments of lease obligations. As of March 31, 2021, the company had $99.2 million of cash on hand deposited in bank accounts, with 96% located in the United States, and limited credit risk associated with its cash balances. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the company's results of operations during fiscal year 2021, and its ongoing financial impact remains uncertain. To secure its liquidity position, the company has taken proactive measures, including strict cost management actions such as halting marketing programs, eliminating non-essential expenses, reducing payroll and related costs, and reducing capital expenditures. The company believes that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient funds to meet its short- and long-term liquidity requirements. The company's total debt was approximately $0.1 million as of March 31, 2021, comprised of finance lease obligations. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.4 million in fiscal year 2021, $10.6 million in fiscal year 2020, and $7.2 million in fiscal year 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 were $1.4 million, primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021 were $25.3 million, primarily consisting of preferred stock issuance proceeds from the Mak Capital investment.

Debt
The company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that would impact their financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Their contractual obligations are mainly operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends, which are disclosed in their consolidated financial statements. The company believes that their cash on hand, funds from operations, and access to capital markets will be sufficient to finance their needs and service their obligations in the foreseeable future.
