Results of Operations
The total revenues for fiscal year 2021 for a company increased by 17% to $387.2 million from $331 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase in revenues occurred across all product types, with license revenue accounting for 52.2% of total revenue, followed by connected services revenue at 28.3% and professional services revenue at 19.5%. The increase in license revenue was due to a higher volume of licensing royalties as the global auto industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and Original Equipment Manufacturers increased production. However, the semiconductor shortage in the industry may impact the company's license revenue. The company's total cost of revenues decreased by 6.3% to $101.1 million, resulting in an increase in total gross profit by 28.2% to $286.1 million, primarily driven by license and connected services solutions. Research and development expenses increased by 26.1% to $112.1 million, mainly due to headcount growth and third-party contractor costs. The text provides financial information for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021 for an unnamed company. Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses decreased by 4.5% in fiscal year 2020, partly due to a shift in R&amp;D workforce to support professional service teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 15.8% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to salary-related expenses and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses increased by 15.4% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to stock-based compensation, depreciation, and professional service fees. Intangible asset amortization decreased by 3.2% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to certain assets being fully amortized. Restructuring and other costs decreased by $11.4 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to decreased expenditures to establish the company as a standalone public company.
