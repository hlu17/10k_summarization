Business Overview
The text describes a cloud-based software provider that streamlines financial operations for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company's platform uses artificial intelligence to digitize and automate tasks such as generating and processing invoices, making and receiving payments, and reconciling books. The company has partnerships with top accounting firms and financial institutions, allowing customers to access mission-critical services through a single connection. The company has grown rapidly, with total revenue and net losses of $238.3 million and $98.7 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2021. The company recently acquired Divvy, a provider of cloud-based spend management applications, for $2.3 billion, and entered into an agreement to acquire Invoice2go, a mobile-first accounts receivable software provider, for $625 million. The company also issues business-purpose charge cards through partnerships with banks, utilizing proprietary risk management capabilities to confirm business identity and creditworthiness. The company purchases participation interests in receivables originated through its platform, funding a substantial portion of these purchases through credit facilities with finance partners. The company's efficient go-to-market strategy and recurring revenue model result in a short payback period.

Results of Operations
The table provided shows the company's results of operations and components of consolidated statements of operations for the presented periods. The revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was mainly from subscription and transaction fees, which increased by 70%, while interest on funds held for customers decreased by 72% due to a decrease in yield from investing customer funds. However, the average daily balance of customer funds in transit increased by 37% due to growth in total payment volume (TPV), which increased by 45%. Cost of revenue increased by 31%, but gross margin increased by 3%, driven by higher revenue on new product offerings. Research and development expenses increased by 85% and sales and marketing expenses by 51%, both due to an increase in headcount resulting in higher personnel-related costs. General and administrative expenses also increased by 85%. The company acquires card receivables and establishes an allowance for credit losses based on an estimate of uncollectible balances. Models and assumptions are used to determine reserve rates applicable to outstanding acquired card receivable balances to estimate reserves for expected credit losses. The company writes off card receivables after the entire balance becomes 120 days delinquent.

Revenues
The company generates revenue from two sources: subscription and transaction fees, and interest on funds held for customers. Subscription fees are charged on a per user per period basis, while transaction fees are collected for each transaction processed through their platform. The company also earns interest from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $71.4 million during fiscal 2021 from $45.4 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $26.0 million or 57%. The company's revenue is primarily based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user charged to their customers, and much of their revenue comes from repeat transactions. The company defines TPV as the value of customer transactions processed on their platform during a particular period, which is an important indicator of their ability to generate revenue from their customers.

Gross Profit Margin
The text provides financial information for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, including cost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margin. Cost of revenue increased by 58% from $39.1 million in 2020 to $61.8 million in 2021 due to various factors such as personnel-related costs, processing customers' transactions, and investment of customer funds. Gross margin decreased from 75% in 2020 to 74% in 2021 mainly due to the amortization of acquired developed technologies. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin were defined as gross profit and gross margin, respectively, excluding intangible assets' amortization, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation expense. The company believes non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. The text also provides information on research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, including their primary components and expected fluctuations from period to period due to investments in growing the business and supporting growth initiatives.

Operating Income
The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP financial statements in order to understand and evaluate their core operating performance. These measures are presented to enhance investors' understanding of their financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial information. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information and transparency with respect to important metrics used by their management for financial and operational decision-making. They regularly review several metrics to measure their performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The calculation of these metrics may differ from other companies, analysts, or investors.

Liquidity
As of June 30, 2021, the principal sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, available-for-sale short-term investments of $655.3 million, and credit lines. The company issued $1.15 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2025, which are unsecured obligations and may be converted by holders during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2021, under certain circumstances. The company expects its current sources of liquidity to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months, but may consider raising additional capital through equity or debt financing to fund future obligations. The company's cash flows are primarily from its revenue streams, which include subscription and transaction fees, and its primary uses of cash are for employee costs, third-party payments, sales and marketing expenses, and other corporate expenditures. The company's net cash provided by financing activities increased due to proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 notes, exercises of stock options, and employee purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. Net cash used in investing activities increased due to the purchase of corporate and customer fund short-term investments, payment made to acquire Divvy, and an increase in purchases of property and equipment.

Debt
The company is obligated to purchase all card receivables from US-based card issuing banks, including authorized transactions that have not cleared. As of June 30, 2021, the authorized but not cleared transactions totaled $30.3 million, which has not been recorded on the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company has off-balance sheet credit exposures with these authorized but not cleared transactions, but the expected credit losses with respect to these transactions were not significant as of June 30, 2021. The company accounts for its convertible senior notes by separating the principal amount into liability and equity components. The company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease by evaluating whether there is an identified asset and whether the company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The company's principal commitments to settle its contractual obligations are disclosed, including its credit agreements. The company had total outstanding borrowings of $77.5 million as of June 30, 2021, and the available funds under its credit agreements, after deducting its borrowings, were also $77.5 million.
