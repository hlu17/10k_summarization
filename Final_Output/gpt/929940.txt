Business Overview
AspenTech is a global leader in asset optimization software that uses big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced analytics to improve the competitiveness and profitability of its customers in complex, industrial environments. Its software is purpose-built to optimize asset design, operations, and maintenance across engineering, manufacturing and supply chain, and asset performance management. The company combines its proprietary mathematical and empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes with AI capabilities to create insights, provide guidance, and automate and democratize knowledge, known as industrial AI. AspenTech has approximately 2,500 customers globally, including companies in the energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods industries. The company has two operating and reportable segments: (i) subscription and software, which includes its license and maintenance revenue, and (ii) services and other, which includes professional services and training. AspenTech generates revenue from license revenue, maintenance revenue, and services and other revenue. The company licenses its software products primarily through a subscription offering, which includes software maintenance and support for the entire term. AspenTech also licenses its software through point product term arrangements. The company determines revenue recognition by identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue as it satisfies a performance obligation.

Results of Operations
The table presented shows financial data for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Total revenue increased by $110.7 million in 2021 compared to the previous year due to increases in license and maintenance revenue, partially offset by a decrease in services and other revenue. In 2020, total revenue increased by $2.0 million due to an increase in maintenance and services and other revenue, partially offset by a decrease in license revenue. Free cash flow increased in both years primarily due to changes in working capital. Cash from operating activities provided $276.1 million in 2021 and $243.3 million in 2020, resulting from net income and non-cash items adjusted for net uses of cash related to changes in working capital. In 2019, cash from operating activities provided $238.3 million, resulting from net income and non-cash items, adjusted for net sources of cash related to changes in working capital. The changes in working capital were primarily due to increases in contract assets, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Revenues
Aspen Technology generates revenue primarily from license revenue, which includes software maintenance and support. The AspenOne licensing model includes three suites: engineering, manufacturing and supply chain, and asset performance management, and is licensed by customer sites, user seats or cloud connections. The engineering and manufacturing and supply chain product suites are licensed by tokens, which are interchangeable measures of usage based on various units of measure, and customers may use tokens flexibly to access one or more products in the suite in any combination. The company also generates revenue from maintenance, technical support, and services, including training and professional services. Revenue from professional services is recognized by measuring progress toward the completion of obligations. In addition to GAAP measures, the company uses non-GAAP business metrics to track performance. Revenue for training services is recognized in the period in which the services are performed, and when directly observable data is not available for term licenses and maintenance, the company estimates a standalone selling price for these distinct performance obligations using relevant information.

Gross Profit Margin
The text discusses the cost of license, maintenance, and services and other revenue for the company, and how they contribute to the gross profit. The cost of license revenue includes royalties, amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets, and distribution fees. The cost of maintenance revenue primarily consists of personnel-related costs of providing premier plus SMS bundled with AspenOne licensing and point product arrangements. The cost of services and other revenue includes personnel-related and external consultant costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Gross profit increased by $112.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year, with a gross profit margin of 91.5%. In fiscal 2020, gross profit decreased by $(1.8) million compared to the prior year, with a consistent gross profit margin of 89.7%. Operating expenses are not discussed in detail.

Operating Income
The text discusses the various expenses incurred by a company, including selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Selling expenses primarily relate to personnel and travel expenses for licensing products and managing customer relationships, while marketing expenses cover promoting the company and conducting market research. Research and development expenses are related to creating new software products and enhancing existing ones. General and administrative expenses include personnel expenses for corporate and support functions, outside professional and consultant fees, and amortization of intangible assets. The company's primary source of cash is from software license arrangements and related support services. Non-GAAP income from operations, which excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, is used as a supplement to GAAP income from operations to provide additional insight into recurring profitability and cash flow. The table presented in the text shows the company's income from operations adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and other items.

Interest Expense
During fiscal year 2021, interest expense decreased by $4.6 million compared to fiscal year 2020 due to lower interest associated with the revolving line of credit as a result of repayment of the outstanding balance and a lower interest rate on the term loan. In contrast, during fiscal year 2020, interest expense increased by $3.1 million compared to fiscal year 2019 due to interest expenses related to an increase in borrowings under the credit agreement.

Liquidity
The company used $165.1 million of cash from financing activities during fiscal year 2021, including repayment of outstanding loans and stock repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from employee stock options.

Total contract value was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Bookings were $774.5 million in fiscal year 2021, compared to $610.1 million and $651.8 million in fiscal year 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Debt
As of June 30, 2021, the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. In December 2019, the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and other lenders, providing for a $200 million secured revolving credit facility and a $320 million secured term loan facility. The indebtedness under the revolving credit facility matures on December 23, 2024. During fiscal year 2021, the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility was paid off, leaving current borrowings of $20 million consisting of the term loan facility. Non-current borrowings consist of $276 million of the term loan facility, net of $2.8 million in debt issuance costs. The company has $62.4 million of contractual obligations, including rent and fixed fees for all of its operating leases. The company also has standby letters of credit issued by Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, securing its performance on professional services contracts and certain facility leases. The table provided does not reflect a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.1 million as of June 30, 2021, which the company estimates will not be paid within the next year, and the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability is currently unknown.
