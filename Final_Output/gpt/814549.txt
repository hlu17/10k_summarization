Revenues
Sales and marketing expenses for a certain company decreased by 29% or $5.7 million from $19.6 million in 2019 to $13.8 million in 2020. The decrease is mainly caused by lowered costs on advertising and marketing as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Operating Income
Ebix Inc, a provider of software and e-commerce services, generated $100.4m of net cash flow from operating activities in the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.8m in 2019, representing an increase of $39.6m or 65%. The primary reason for the increase was a reduction in accounts receivable from trade and service providers due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which reduced revenue but resulted in more accounts receivable conversions to cash than in 2019. The company's total revenue increased $45m, or 8%, to $625.6m in 2020 compared to $580.6m in 2019, primarily due to strong demand for its payment solutions offerings in India, which increased by more than $200m year-over-year. However, the company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance, and e-learning businesses had a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150m, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, which offset the growth in the payments solutions business.

Interest Expense
The company's interest expense decreased by 25% or $10.8 million from $42.3 million in 2019 to $31.6 million in 2020. This was mainly due to lower Libor interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019. The company's working capital facilities in India also had lower average balances in 2020, which generally carry interest rates between 6.75% and 9.45%. The decrease in working capital was due to both Covid-19's impact on operations and renegotiated customer agreements that improved payment terms in 2020 relative to 2019.

Liquidity
The principal sources of liquidity for the company are the cash flows generated by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents on hand. The company intends to use these funds, combined with the possible issuance of additional debt or equity, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, as well as to make strategic business acquisitions, retire outstanding indebtedness, and repurchase shares of its common stock. The company believes that its anticipated cash flows, current cash balances, and access to credit and capital markets will be sufficient to meet its projected cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and market conditions are subject to substantial uncertainty. The company regularly evaluates its liquidity requirements and may raise funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. The company's current ratio and working capital position increased in 2020 due to a reduction in cash used for acquisitions, a decrease in trade accounts receivable, and a decrease in current liabilities. The company believes that its ability to generate sustainable cash flow from operations will enable it to meet its debt obligations and fund its current liabilities from available cash balances. Net cash used by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of a decrease in year-end balances in the company's working capital facilities in India, payments against the company's outstanding credit facility term loan, and quarterly dividend payments to common stockholders. Net cash used for investing activities in 2020 primarily related to a decrease in investment in marketable securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and software development. The company's cash and cash equivalents are held in both domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries may result in taxes and other restrictions.
