Business Overview
Surveymonkey is a software company that provides agile solutions to help companies collect, analyze, and act on feedback from stakeholders. Its platform enables users to collect feedback from customers, employees, website and app users, and market research audiences. The company offers SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillars: surveys, customer experience, and market research. The company operates as a single operating segment, with its CEO serving as the chief operating decision maker. Surveymonkey is evolving from a self-serve online survey tool provider into an enterprise SaaS company. Its two-part growth strategy involves delivering new features and product tiers to increase platform usage and investing in product innovation and go-to-market initiatives to win new customers. The company's existing user base is a significant opportunity for expansion and revenue growth. In 2020, approximately 29% of its total revenue was generated from customers who purchased software through its enterprise sales force. Surveymonkey has over 20 million active users, of which approximately 820,300 are paying users. Its dollar-based net retention rate for organizational domain-based customers was over 100% as of December 31, 2020. The company generates most of its revenue from the sale of subscriptions to its products, which are structured into three primary product pillars. Surveymonkey offers products from its survey and market research pillars on a self-serve basis through its website and provides a suite of enterprise-grade feedback software solutions from all three pillars through its direct sales force.

Results of Operations
The text presents the results of SurveyMonkey's operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The company's revenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in enterprise sales and revenue from the self-serve channel. The number of paying users and the average revenue per user (ARPU) also increased in 2020. The cost of revenue increased in 2020 due to increased website hosting costs, payment processing fees, and amortization of intangible assets. Research and development expenses increased in 2020 due to personnel-related costs and a decrease in software development costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2020 due to personnel-related costs, costs related to brand campaigns and paid marketing, and amortization of intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased in 2020 due to personnel-related costs and a decrease in travel expenses. Interest expense and other non-operating income, net decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. The provision for income taxes increased in 2020 due to taxes incurred in connection with a taxable sale of intangible assets and the partial release of the valuation allowance in 2019.

Revenues
The majority of the revenue for the company comes from selling subscriptions to software products for survey feedback and customer experience, and a small portion comes from transactional market research solutions. Revenue is recognized over the subscription term, usually ranging from one month to one year. The contracts are generally non-cancellable, and subscription fees are collected primarily from credit cards through the company's website at the beginning of the subscription period. The company uses ARPU as an important measure to show investors changes in per-user revenue, reflecting their ability to successfully upsell or cross-sell their products and purpose-built solutions. However, ARPU has limitations as an analytic tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures.

Gross Profit Margin
The company allocates shared costs, such as depreciation on equipment and employee benefits, to all departments based on headcount. Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of products, such as infrastructure costs, personnel costs, and other related costs. Research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs, costs for third-party consultants, depreciation of equipment, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs, costs related to brand campaigns, paid marketing, and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs for legal, finance, human resources, and other administrative functions, as well as certain executives. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the enterprise sales channel, with increased revenue from the self-serve channel in 2020 due to demand arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's gross margins increased primarily due to the increase in revenue.

Operating Income
The company uses a number of operating and financial metrics to evaluate their business, measure their performance, identify trends, formulate their business plan, and make strategic decisions. In addition to results determined in accordance with GAAP, they believe that free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating their business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Interest Expense
The text explains that the interest expense of a company includes the interest on their credit facilities. In addition, for the year 2018, interest expense also consisted of interest on financing obligations related to their corporate headquarters. For more information about their credit facilities, readers can refer to Note 12 in the annual report.

Liquidity
The principal sources of liquidity for the company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were cash and cash equivalents, cash from customers, and credit facilities. The company has primarily financed its operations through customer payments, borrowings under credit facilities and lines of credit, and its initial public offering in 2018. The company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities, and cash from product sales will be enough to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. However, the company may need additional financing in the future, which it may not be able to raise on acceptable terms or at all. The company has deferred revenue of $170.6 million as of December 31, 2020, which it expects to record as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The company has historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities, primarily from cash collections from customers for subscriptions to its products. The company's primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures for equipment and internal-use software development. The company defines free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. The company expects to generate positive free cash flow over the long term.

Debt
As of December 31, 2020, the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. The company's principal commitments consist of obligations under credit facilities and leases for office space. The future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were outlined as of December 31, 2020.
