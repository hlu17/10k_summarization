Business Overview
The primary opportunities and risks associated with the business include dependence on capital spending patterns, acquisition opportunities and risks, competitive technologies, and competition in general. The company relies on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which are subject to economic trends and conditions beyond their control. There are opportunities for acquisitions or investments to expand sales distribution channels and broaden the product offering, but there are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products, and technologies, such as not achieving the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of the transaction. There is a risk that competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company's technology, and the market for business application software and related services is intensely competitive. Some competitors may become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms, which could adversely affect the company's profit margins. For more information, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.

Results of Operations
The table provides information on revenue and expense items as a percentage of total revenue for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. It also shows the percentage increase or decrease in these items for the years 2020 and 2021. "NM" indicates that the percentage change is not meaningful.

Revenues
The financial report for the year ended April 30, 2021, shows a 4% decrease in total revenue, mainly due to a 61% decrease in license revenue and a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue. However, subscription fees revenue increased by 31%. International revenue represented 15% of total revenue in FY2021, and the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower marketing spend and travel costs due to COVID-19. The report also highlights a lag in professional services and other revenue compared to license revenue by one to three quarters, and that the majority of future license fee sales will be to existing on-premise customers for add-on expansion. Additionally, margins after commissions for direct sales were relatively consistent, between 84% to 88%, while the range for indirect sales had a wider spread of 53% to 58%.

Gross Profit Margin
The table shows dollar amounts and percentage measures of gross margin for the fiscal years ending April 30, 2019, 2020, and 2021. The total gross margin percentage for 2021 decreased to 54% compared to the prior year due to decreases in professional services, license fees, and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by an increase in subscription fees. The gross margin percentage on subscription fees increased from 57% to 59% in 2021 due to an increase in subscription revenue and lower software amortization expense. The gross margin percentage on license fees decreased in 2021 due to lower revenue. The gross margin percentage on professional services and other decreased in 2021 due to lower project utilization rates. The maintenance gross margin decreased in 2021 due to cost containment efforts. In 2020, the total gross margin percentage increased to 55% due to increases in license fees, professional services, and other gross margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by a decrease in subscription fees. The gross margin percentage on subscription fees decreased in 2020 due to an increase in software amortization expense. The gross margin percentage on license fees increased in 2020 due to lower agent commission and amortization of intangibles expense and higher revenue. The gross margin percentage on professional services and other increased in 2020 due to increased revenue and higher billing utilization, except for the IT consulting segment. The maintenance gross margin increased in 2020 due to cost containment efforts.

Operating Income
The company's SCM segment operating income decreased by 4% in fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous year, primarily due to a 5% drop in revenue. However, the segment had seen a 23% increase in operating income in fiscal year 2020 as revenue had gone up by 10%. In contrast, the IT consulting segment's operating income increased by 37% in fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous year, thanks to a 6% increase in revenue from project billing. However, the segment had seen a 66% decrease in operating income in fiscal year 2020 compared to the previous year due to lower revenue and gross margins from project billing. The other segment saw an increase in operating loss in fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous year, primarily due to a 14% drop in revenue and higher variable compensation and benefit costs. In fiscal year 2020, the segment had also seen an increase in operating loss compared to the previous year due to higher variable compensation and overhead costs, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue.

Liquidity
The company funds its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operating activities, and has no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The company had $104.7 million in total cash and investments as of April 30, 2021, with no outstanding debt, and believes that its sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months.
