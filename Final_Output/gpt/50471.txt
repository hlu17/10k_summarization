Business Overview
The company is a SaaS provider that owns ReposiTrak, a B2B e-commerce, compliance, and supply chain management platform for retailers, wholesalers, and product suppliers. ReposiTrak helps these businesses source, vet, and transact with their suppliers to improve sales, control risks, and supply chain efficiencies. The company's fiscal year ends on June 30, and any references to fiscal 2021 refer to the year that ended on that date.

Revenues
The company had a revenue of $21,007,076 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, a 5% increase from the previous year, due to growth in subscription revenue and marketplace revenue. However, there was a decrease of $145,500 in one-time license revenue that occurred in 2020 but did not happen in 2021. The company's ability to source hard-to-find items for its customers during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased revenue attributable to marketplace, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, freezers, and telecommunication equipment. The company's principal customers are multi-store retail chains, wholesalers, distributors, and their suppliers, and it generates revenue from five sources: subscription fees, transaction-based fees, professional services fees, license fees, and hosting and maintenance fees. Subscription revenue comes from recurring subscription payments for the company's supply chain solutions and compliance and food safety solutions. Marketplace revenue is transactional and based on the volume of products sourced via the application. The company also provides professional consulting services, premier customer support, and sells its software in the form of a license. The company's hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of its software and customers' data.

Gross Profit Margin
The cost of services and product support for a certain company was $6,884,647, which is 33% of total revenue for the year ending June 30, 2021. This represents a 2% decrease from the previous year, which is mainly due to higher expenses related to marketplace and sales of PPE, as well as an increase in non-capitalized hardware/software items necessary for information systems security, equipment licensing, and database systems maintenance. Despite experiencing a significant increase in marketplace costs and revenue during the pandemic due to PPE demand, it is uncertain what ongoing marketplace costs may be as the pandemic subsides.

Operating Income
The company has historically provided investors with non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP income per share. These measures are used by management and the board of directors for trend analysis and planning purposes. However, they should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial measures and are subject to limitations. Investors should review reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures included in the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

Liquidity
The company's net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, was $5,401,815, which increased by 29% compared to the previous year due to higher revenues and lower operating costs. The net cash used in financing activities decreased to $1,357,950 primarily due to the payoff of a financing arrangement with a bank and a decrease in the stock buyback program. The company's existing cash and short-term investments, along with funds generated from operations, are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months. The company historically funded its operations with cash from operations, equity financings, and borrowings from the issuance of debt. The company had positive working capital of $20,400,991 at June 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cash resulting from higher revenue. The increase in current assets is primarily due to an increase in cash, while the comparative increase in current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in the line of credit. The company believes it will continue to increase its cash flow from operations and working capital position in subsequent periods and have adequate cash resources to fund its operations and satisfy its debt obligations for at least the next 12 months.

Debt
The company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that would affect its financial condition, revenue, liquidity or capital expenditures. The total contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2021 are presented in a table.
