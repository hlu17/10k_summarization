Results of Operations
The text provides highlights for fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures, which are discussed in further detail in the "non-GAAP financial measures" section of the document. Dividends paid to stockholders represented 83% of net income for 2021, compared to 81% for 2020. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Further analysis of the company's results of operations and financial position can be found in the "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources" sections. Changes in revenue compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by various factors not specified in the text.

Revenues
The company's fiscal 2021 revenue of $3.0 billion increased by 2% due to payroll client base growth, increased penetration of solutions, and growth in ancillary products and services. However, there was a decline in check volumes due to lower employment levels during the pandemic. Service revenue is recognized when services are rendered, and insurance solutions revenue is recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for funding payrolls of clients in the temporary staffing industry are recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 45 days. PEO solutions revenue is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, and direct costs related to workersâ€™ compensation and certain benefit plans where the company retains risk are recognized as cost of service revenue. Interest on funds held for clients is earned and included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

Gross Profit Margin
The company plans to accelerate its long-term strategy to reduce its geographic footprint and optimize headcount, which is expected to result in ongoing savings in rent, facilities maintenance, and wage-related expenses. This initiative will cost $32.2 million in fiscal year 2021.

Operating Income
The text discusses various financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA. These measures are not calculated using US GAAP and should be used in conjunction with the US GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. The table summarizes the total combined cost of service revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal years and explains that changes in total expenses were primarily driven by factors such as higher performance-based compensation, lower wage-related costs, and an increase in workers' compensation costs and claims estimates. Fiscal 2021 operating income was $1.5 billion, comparable to fiscal 2020, while adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 2%. Net income was $1.1 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, while adjusted net income was $1.1 billion for both years, reflecting an increase of 2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and $3.00 per diluted share for fiscal 2020, reflecting an increase of 1%.

Liquidity
The financial position of the company as of May 31, 2021, was strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.1 billion, while total short-term and long-term borrowings were $804.7 million. The primary source of cash is generated by the company's ongoing operations, and cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2021, allowing the company to support its business and pay dividends of approximately $909.0 million. The company anticipates that its cash, projected operating cash flows, and available short-term financing will support its business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its investments in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2021, were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in its assessment. The changes in the company's cash flows for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were primarily the result of fluctuations in the net purchases and sales/maturities of assets, timing of estimated income tax payments, and increases in accrued worksite employee compensation and corporate compensation due to higher performance-based compensation in fiscal 2021. The company also repurchased 1.7 million shares and 2.0 million shares during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, with $72.4 million remaining available under the common stock repurchase program. The payment of future dividends is dependent on the company's future earnings and cash flows and is subject to the discretion of its board.

Debt
The company maintains credit facilities and letters of credit to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. The company borrows on an overnight or short-term basis on their credit facilities, and details of their credit facilities are available in their financial statements. The company has access to the amounts available under their current credit facilities to meet their ongoing financial needs, but if they experience reductions in their operating cash flows, they may need to adjust their capital, operating, and other discretionary spending to realign their working capital requirements. The company also has long-term contractual obligations, including operating leases, purchase obligations, workers' compensation estimated obligations, and long-term senior notes debt obligations. The company is involved in venture capital funds and makes representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. The company self-insures the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health and medical benefit plans and maintains corporate insurance coverage in addition to purchased primary insurance policies.
