Business Overview: Accounting for our business combinations requires significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration. Changes in estimates and assumptions may affect earnings and have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Our revenue is primarily derived from on-premises software and SaaS subscriptions, professional services and scoring services, and is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers. We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to products and services, technology, labor, stockholder and other matters, for which we assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses. Revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

Results of Operations: The company is organized into two reportable segments: software and scores. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the company reevaluated its operating segments and changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services, and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services and scores. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation and the timing of satisfaction of a performance obligation in certain professional services contracts with a fixed consideration. Adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known.

Revenues: FICO reported total GAAP revenue of $1.32 billion for fiscal year 2021, a 2% increase from fiscal year 2020. Revenue for their scores segment was $654.1 million, a 24% increase from the previous year. Annual recurring revenue for their software segment as of September 30, 2021 was $524 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, excluding divestitures. Operating income was $505.5 million, a 71% increase from fiscal 2020. Net income was $392.1 million, a 66% increase from fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations was $423.8 million, compared with $364.9 million generated during the prior year. Total debt balance was $1.268 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared with $845 million as of September 30, 2020. $882.2 million was spent on share repurchases, compared with $235.2 million spent during the prior year.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin decreased to 25% in 2021 from 28% in 2020 due to increased sales of higher-margin scores products. Cost of revenues increased by $24.3 million in 2020 over 2019, primarily due to increased allocated facilities and infrastructure costs, personnel and labor costs and direct materials costs, partially offset by decreased travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 28% in 2020, materially consistent with 2019. The 2021 decrease of $28.7 million in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to decreased personnel and labor costs, allocated facilities and infrastructure costs and travel costs, partially offset by increased direct materials costs. These decreases were largely driven by strategic cost initiatives implemented in September 2020 and the divestiture of the C&R business in June 2021.

Operating Income: Operating Income for Fiscal 2021: Increase of $209.5 million primarily due to $100.1 million gain on product line asset sales, $59.5 million decrease in segment operating expenses, $37.1 million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges, $22.0 million increase in segment revenues, and $7.8 million decrease in corporate expenses. Scores Segment Operating Income: Increase of $106.4 million due to $125.6 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by $19.2 million increase in segment operating expenses. Software Segment Operating Income: Decrease of $24.9 million due to $103.6 million decrease in segment revenue, partially offset by $78.7 million decrease in segment operating expenses. Operating Income for Fiscal 2020: Increase of $42.4 million due to $134.5 million increase in segment revenues and $1.1 million decrease in amortization expense, partially offset by $45.0 million increase in restructuring and impairment charges, $37.5 million increase in segment operating expenses, and $10.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Scores Segment Operating Income: Increase of $93.0 million due to $107.4 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by $14.4 million increase in segment operating expenses. Software Segment Operating Income: Increase of $4.0 million due to $27.1 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by $23.1 million increase in segment operating expenses.

Interest Expense: interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in december 2019, may 2018, and july 2010 (which july 2010 senior notes were paid in full at maturity in july 2020), as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit. on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, interest expense is netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements. the fiscal 2021 from 2020 decrease in net interest expense of $2.1 million was primarily attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2021. the fiscal 2020 over 2019 increase in net interest expense of $2.4 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2020.

Liquidity: In fiscal 2021, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $423.8 million, an increase of $58.9 million from fiscal 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in net income and timing of receipts and payments, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash items. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $137.9 million, a $162.5 million increase from fiscal 2020, primarily from proceeds from asset sales and business divestiture and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $523.6 million, a $234.2 million increase from fiscal 2020, primarily due to repurchases of common stock, payments on senior notes and revolving line of credit.

Debt: as of september 30, 2021, we had $300.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.150%. Summary: As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value of the senior notes was $750.0 million and the borrowings outstanding were $818.0 million. The senior notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 5.25% and 4.00% per annum, respectively, and will mature on May 15, 2026, and June 15, 2028. The credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of $600 million and an unsecured term loan of $300 million, both with a maturity of August 19, 2026. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.750% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.750%.
