We have 85 of the top 100 accounting firms and six of the top ten largest financial institutions in the US as our partners. We completed the acquisition of DivvyPay, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 billion and entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Invoice2Go for aggregate consideration of $625.0 million.

Results of Operations: Results of Operations: Revenue components of our revenue during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows: subscription and transaction fees increased to $232.3 million during fiscal 2021 from $136.4 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $95.9 million or 70%. Interest on funds held for customers decreased to $6.0 million during fiscal 2021 from $21.2 million during fiscal 2020, a decrease of $15.2 million or 72%. The decrease was due mainly to the decrease in the yield we earned from investing customer funds, partially offset by the increase in the balance of customer funds held while payment transactions clear. The average daily balance of customer funds in transit increased to approximately $1.9 billion during fiscal 2021 from approximately $1.4 billion during fiscal 2020, an increase of 37%. Cost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margin increased to $39.1 million during fiscal 2020 from $29.9 million during fiscal 2019, an increase of $9.2 million or 31%.

Revenues: We generate revenue from two sources: subscription and transaction fees, and interest on funds held for customers. Subscription fees are charged on a per user per period basis, normally monthly or annually. Transaction fees are collected for each transaction processed through our platform, on either a fixed or variable fee basis. These fees include processing of payments in the form of checks, ACH, cross-border payments, virtual cards, creation of invoices, and interchange income from merchants that accept Divvy cards. We enter into multi-year contracts with financial institutions which typically include fees for initial implementation services and subscription and transaction processing services, subject to guaranteed monthly minimum fees. We recognize the transaction price as a single performance obligation based on the proportion of transactions processed to the total estimated transactions to be processed over the contract period. We also earn interest on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while their payment transactions are clearing. This revenue can fluctuate depending on the amount of customer funds held, as well as our yield on customer funds invested.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin decreased to 74% during fiscal 2021 from 75% during fiscal 2020, a decrease of 1% due primarily to the amortization of acquired developed technologies. Cost of revenue increased to $61.8 million during fiscal 2021 from $39.1 million during fiscal 2020, an increase of $22.7 million or 58%. Research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period.

Operating Income: This financial report uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate core operating performance and provide transparency to investors. These measures are used to compare the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The report regularly reviews several metrics, including operating income, to measure performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.

Liquidity: Principal sources of liquidity as of June 30, 2021 are cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, available-for-sale short-term investments of $655.3 million, and available lines of credit of $155.0 million. On November 30, 2020, we issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes (2025 notes) due on December 1, 2025. We believe our cash and investments are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2021 from $863.1 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 notes, increase in exercises of stock options, increase in employee purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and increase in customer funds liability. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $1.4 billion during fiscal 2021 from $249.5 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to the increase in purchases of corporate and customer fund short-term investments, payment made to acquire Divvy, increase in acquired card receivables, and increase in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided in operating activities increased to $4.6 million during fiscal 2021 from a net cash used of $4.4 million during fiscal 2020 due mainly to the increase in subscription and transaction fees revenue.

Debt: The company is contractually obligated to purchase all card receivables from U.S. based card issuing banks, including authorized transactions that have not cleared and totaled $30.3 million as of June 30, 2021. Off-balance sheet credit exposures with these transactions exist, but expected credit losses were not significant as of June 30, 2021. The company accounts for its convertible senior notes by separating the principal amount into liability and equity components, with the difference initially recorded as a debt discount and amortized as interest expense. Lease arrangements are classified as operating or financing at the lease commencement date, with operating lease assets and liabilities recognized at the present value of lease payments. Principal commitments to settle contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021 include a 2021 revolving credit agreement with a total commitment of $95.0 million and a 2019 amended credit agreement with a total commitment of $60.0 million, with the outstanding borrowings totaling $77.5 million.
