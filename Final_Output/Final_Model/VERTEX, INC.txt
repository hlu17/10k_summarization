Business Overview: Business Overview: We have historically seen higher software subscription agreements with new and existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year. This is due to the annual customer agreement terms and the renewal of contracts at the end of the year. This seasonality is reflected in our revenues and commission expenses. Our quarterly revenues have generally increased over the last two years due to new sales to existing and new customers. However, due to the timing of budget decisions, there may be volatility in the amount of business transacted and revenues recorded. Operating expenses have increased due to headcount and related expenses and investments in technology development projects and cloud solutions. We have used stock-based compensation programs as a component of overall compensation expense, and in connection with the offering, granted equity awards with a fair value of approximately $15.1 million. We anticipate our stock-based compensation expense will be significantly higher in the future. We have an extensive partner network to enhance coverage and adoption of our solutions and promote our thought leadership. We plan to invest to enhance our software and content, and may pursue acquisitions, development arrangements, or similar activities to accelerate this. On January 25, 2021, we acquired Tellutax. We expect a shift to cloud solutions from existing and new customers which will have a favorable impact on our long-term ARR. We recognize revenue from cloud-based subscriptions ratably over the life of the contract, and as more of our sales shift to cloud, our revenue growth rate may increase. We may see a decrease in gross margin due to associated hosting costs.

Revenues: Revenues increased 18.0% to $321.5 million in 2019 compared to $272.4 million in 2018, mainly driven by $29.0 million in revenue growth from existing customers, $11.0 million from new customers, and $9.1 million in services revenues. Cost of software subscriptions and services revenues increased 12.1% and 23.8%, respectively, due to costs of personnel supporting year-over-year growth of sales and customers, and ongoing infrastructure investments. Research and development expenses increased 28.6%, primarily due to increased development activity associated with nascent technologies and new solutions. Selling and marketing expenses increased 19.7%, mainly due to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with the growth in subscription and services revenues. General and administrative expenses increased 20.5%, primarily due to planned strategic investments in information technology infrastructure, business process reengineering and other initiatives. Net revenue retention rate (NRR) was 106%, 109% and 104% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ARR increased by $37.9 million or 13.6% from 2019 to 2020, mainly driven by $17.5 million of growth in revenues from existing customers and $20.4 million of on-premise and cloud-based subscriptions of our tax solutions to new customers. 300 basis point decrease in NRR from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to reduction in sales growth to existing customers related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 500 basis point increase in NRR from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by growth of $21.6 million in recurring subscription revenues from existing customers.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin: Software subscriptions cost of revenues consists of personnel and related expenses, direct costs associated with information technology, amortization associated with direct labor, costs associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets, and costs for new products and enhancements. Services cost of revenues consists of personnel and related expenses, cost of third-party contractors, and other direct expenses. We plan to expand our infrastructure and personnel to support future growth, resulting in an increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars.

Operating Income: Operating income is evaluated using several metrics, including non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling and marketing expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow margin. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate financial performance and liquidity. The increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2020 and 2019 is driven by an increase in non-GAAP gross profit, partially offset by increases in various non-GAAP operating expense categories, including sales and marketing and research and development investments. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased in 2020 and 2019 due to operating expenses increasing at a higher rate than revenue, driven by investments to enable future growth.

Interest Expense: Interest Expense: Net amount of interest expense exceeding interest income; includes payments, financing costs and write-downs of deferred financing costs; may include adjustments to fair value of contracts to hedge currency fluctuations; changes in settlement value of Systax Acquisition recorded as interest expense. Interest Income: Earnings on investments of cash on hand and funds held for customers; varies with level of funds available for investment and rate of return in market.
