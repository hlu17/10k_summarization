Business Overview: Xperi Holding Corporation is a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor intellectual property and over 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. The company has approximately 1,850 employees and over 30 years of operating experience. On June 1, 2020, Xperi Corporation and TiVo Corporation combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction, resulting in Xperi Holding Corporation becoming the parent company of both Xperi and TiVo. Xperi Holding Corporation's common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on June 2, 2020 under the ticker symbol "XPER". The company is currently contemplating a separation of its product business and IP licensing business through a tax-efficient transaction, with an anticipated completion date in the first half of 2022.

Results of Operations: Over the past three years, significant events have impacted the financial statements, primarily due to the mergers with TiVo. Key events include revenue generation from principal activities such as license agreements in two business segments, product and IP licensing. In addition, costs of licensing, services, and software revenue increased from $8.1 million in 2019 to $57.3 million in 2020, mainly due to the inclusion of $49.0 million of TiVo expenses since the mergers. Cost of hardware revenue also increased from $0.3 million in 2019 to $21.1 million in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of $20.0 million of TiVo expenses since the mergers.Research, development, and other related costs increased from $110.9 million in 2019 to $195.2 million in 2020, due to the inclusion of $76.2 million of post-merger TiVo R&D expenses, increased headcount and personnel costs in Perceive, and severance charges incurred in connection with consolidating and optimizing post-merger operations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from $117.7 million in 2019 to $245.4 million in 2020, mainly due to the inclusion of $92.8 million of TiVo expenses, one-time merger-related transaction costs, post-merger severance and retention costs, and costs associated with the contemplated separation of the business.Depreciation expense increased from $6.7 million in 2019 to $17.9 million in 2020, mainly due to depreciation expense on TiVo fixed assets added since the mergers. Amortization expense increased from $99.9 million in 2019 to $156.8 million in 2020, primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the mergers. Litigation expense also increased from $5.1 million in 2019 to $20.8 million in 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of post-merger TiVo litigation expenses and increased case activity in 2020.

Revenues: Revenues in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of post-merger tivo IP licensing revenue including royalties from Comcast, and semiconductor IP agreements executed during 2020, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from other semiconductor IP license agreements. Operating expenses in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of tivo IP licensing expenses, including significant amortization of intangible assets from the mergers, and increased headcount and personnel costs, partially offset by lower legacy xperi amortization expense. Operating income for 2020 was $402.6 million, an increase of $365.2 million compared to 2019, primarily due to the reasons stated above.

Liquidity: The primary sources of liquidity and capital resources for Xperi are operating cash flows and short-term investments. At the end of 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $257.1 million, an increase of $135.6 million from 2019. This was primarily due to cash generated from operations, net long-term debt proceeds received, cash acquired from TiVo as a result of the mergers, and partially offset by repayment of combined legacy indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, purchases of intangible assets, and dividends paid. Net cash provided by investing activities was $17.8 million in 2020, primarily related to net cash acquired in the mergers and maturities and sales of securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $351.1 million in 2020, mainly due to repayment of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, and dividends paid, partially offset by net long-term debt proceeds. The primary objectives of investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while capturing a market rate of return. Xperi sold 4.2 million shares of Onkyo stock in 2020, for which a realized loss of $0.7 million was recognized. In June 2020, Xperi entered into a credit agreement providing for a $1,050 million five-year senior secured term loan B facility, with an interest rate of either base rate plus 3.00% or LIBOR plus 4.00%. Xperi made a voluntary principal payment of $150.0 million on December 31, 2020. Xperi also initiated a stock repurchase program in June 2020, providing for the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $79.9 million was remaining available for repurchase. Xperi paid quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share in March, May, September and December in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Xperi expects cash flows from operating activities to be sufficient to fund operations, debt service, dividends, stock repurchases and acquisition needs for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available when needed.

Debt: As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations totaled $63 million, including principal cash payments of $63 million due annually beginning March 31, 2022 and variable interest rate payments on long-term debt. Purchase orders for goods and services totaled $32.1 million, and operating leases totaled $94.4 million. Additionally, contingent or variable payments of up to $62.3 million may be due over four years if certain conditions are met. The Company had accrued $94.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits in long-term income taxes payable.
