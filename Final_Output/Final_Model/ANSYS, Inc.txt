Business Overview: The Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the business of ANSYS, including disruptions in how they operate their business, a reduction in revenue, and increased operating expenses. The company has taken measures to mitigate the potential effects of the pandemic, including enabling employees to work from home. They have experienced an increase in revenue due to growth in lease licenses, maintenance and service revenue and contributions from their recent acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue. The non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, transaction expenses related to business combinations, and adjustments related to the transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company also experienced impacts from foreign currency fluctuations and trade restrictions with China. Annual Contract Value (ACV) is a key performance metric used by management to evaluate the performance of the business, and was composed of maintenance and lease contracts, perpetual license contracts, fixed-term services contracts, and the value of work performed on fixed-deliverable services contracts. As of December 31, 2020, the company had $913.2 million in cash and short-term investments, and working capital of $990.4 million. They repurchased 0.7 million shares for $161.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Results of Operations: Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 10.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by investments in sales, support and marketing organizations, multi-year lease contracts and 2020 and 2019 acquisitions. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased, driven by increased salaries and other headcount-related costs, third-party technical support, stock-based compensation, consulting costs, IT maintenance and software hosting costs, foreign exchange translation and business travel. Gross profit increased due to the increase in revenue, partially offset by the increase in related cost of sales. Interest expense increased due to interest incurred on debt financing obtained in connection with the acquisitions of AGI and LST in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income before income tax provision increased, and the effective tax rate decreased due to tax benefits of $7.5 million related to entity structuring activities and increased benefits from research and development credits of $4.1 million. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased, driven by the increase in revenue and decrease in the effective tax rate.

Lease license revenue increased 47.3%, or 49.4% in constant currency, while maintenance revenue grew 12.4%, or 14.3% in constant currency. Service revenue increased 39.1%, or 41.5% in constant currency, and perpetual license revenue decreased 2.5%, or 1.1% in constant currency. The impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased, with the most significant contributions from the Optis and Granta Design acquisitions of $17.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively. Interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances. Income before income tax provision increased to $228.2 million in 2019 from $170.3 million in 2018.

Operating Income: The company reported non-GAAP revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating income, operating profit margin, net income, and diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP in order to evaluate historical and prospective financial performance, set internal targets and budgets, allocate resources, measure operational profitability, assess financial discipline, and determine variable compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures are included.

Liquidity: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 due to increased net income of $25.8 million and increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $21.6 million. This growth was impacted by strong customer receipts in the fourth quarter, including recovery of payments delayed due to COVID-19 and receipt of payments scheduled for 2021. Net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 due to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $214.9 million and decreased capital expenditures of $9.6 million. Capital spending is planned to be $30.0-$40.0 million in fiscal year 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 due to $500.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2019, increased stock repurchases of $101.9 million, and increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of $28.6 million, partially offset by $375.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2020. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments and deposits held at major banks. We plan to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts and have a cumulative temporary difference related to such permanently reinvested earnings of approximately $93.0 million. We believe existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to the $500.0 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. We repurchased shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2020 and 2.8 million shares remain available for repurchase under the program. We continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and intend to invest in the business, acquire or make investments, make payments on outstanding debt balances, and repurchase stock to offset dilution and return capital.
