Interest Expense: interest expense, net decreased by $32.2 million, or 29.8%, in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to decreases in interest rates on our debt. the weighted-average effective interest rate on our debt during the year ended december 31, 2020 was 3.4% compared to 5.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019. see note 9. debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our debt. 48

Liquidity: Cash and cash equivalents were $370.5 million as of December 31, 2020, with international subsidiaries holding $163.4 million of this amount, 39.6% of which was held in euros.
