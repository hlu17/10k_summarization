Business Overview: We provide technology solutions and processing services to the financial services market, commonly referred to as the fintech industry. Our product revenue is derived from licensing our comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors. Our service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, processing services that we provide to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions, and professional services primarily for software customizations. We experienced the loss of a large customer due to insolvency in 2020, and opened offices in Dubai and Chennai, hiring some of the insolvent company's employees and converting some of their customers to our processing platform. We typically receive revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume, and have been able to maintain key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in our professional services revenue. We have a strong cash position and intend to use it to support domestic and international operations and expand our operations in the fintech industry through financing the growth of corecard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. We also have a share repurchase program of $5 million, and made $1.6 million in share repurchases in 2020.

Revenues: â€“ total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $35,873,000 which represents a 5 percent increase over 2019.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin for 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2020 was 57%, up from 66% in 2019. Increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was driven by investments in processing infrastructure, including hardware and software purchases and additional data center space. Cost of revenue includes costs for maintenance, professional services and financial transaction processing. Gross margins can vary depending on customer mix, customer requirements, project complexity and mix of U.S. and offshore employees. Significant investments were made in 2020 in anticipation of new processing customers in 2021 and future years. These investments negatively impacted margins in 2020, but economies of scale in the processing environment are expected in the future. This may be subject to change if new regulations or processing standards are implemented, resulting in additional costs.

Operating Income: Operating Income decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Investment income (loss) was a loss of $1,044,000 in 2020 due to an impairment charge on investments caused by the recent pandemic. Other income, net increased to $378,000 in 2020 due to higher interest income from higher cash and note receivable balances.

Liquidity: Cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $37,956,000, an increase from $26,415,000 at December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operations in 2020 was $20,966,000 compared to $10,585,000 in 2019, largely due to lower accounts receivable, increased cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation, and non-cash investment losses.

No regular or special dividends are expected in the foreseeable future and liquidity from cash on hand and customer payments is expected to support operations and capital equipment purchases.
