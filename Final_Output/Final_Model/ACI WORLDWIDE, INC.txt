Business Overview: ACI Worldwide powers digital payments for more than 6,000 organizations globally, enabling $14 trillion in payments and securities daily. ACI's comprehensive suite of software solutions are used by banks, intermediaries, merchants, and billers to provide real-time, immediate payments capabilities and omni-channel payment experiences. ACI's products are marketed under the ACI Worldwide brand and are sold and supported directly and through regional distribution networks. Key trends impacting ACI's strategies and operations include increasing IT spending levels, growth rate of digital payments, regulatory changes, and economic growth. The company's liquidity needs are met through cash flow generated by operations, cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under a revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, ACI had $165.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $100.0 million of which was available in an uncommitted overdraft facility. The company's 60-month backlog estimate was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.

Adjusted for these impacts, total revenue decreased $85.2 million or 7%. SAAS and PAAS revenue increased $91.5 million or 14% during the year, with Speedpay contributing an additional $123.3 million. Foreign currencies had a negligible impact on SAAS and PAAS revenue. Adjusted for these impacts, SAAS and PAAS revenue decreased $32.4 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily due to declines in transaction volumes within the biller customer base as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19. License revenue decreased $41.4 million or 14% during the year, with foreign currencies having a negligible impact. This decrease was primarily driven by the timing and size of license and capacity events. Maintenance revenue decreased $1.7 million or 1%, with foreign currencies weakening against the US dollar resulting in a $1.8 million decrease. Adjusted for these impacts, maintenance revenue remained flat. Services revenue decreased $12.4 million or 16%, with foreign currencies weakening against the US dollar resulting in a $0.7 million decrease. Adjusted for these impacts, services revenue decreased $11.7 million or 15%. This decrease was primarily driven by the timing and magnitude of project-related work. The adoption of digital payments has accelerated due to digitization of cash, financial inclusion efforts, internet of things, rapid growth of ecommerce, and adoption of real-time payments. Covid-19 has further accelerated this growth. ACI leverages growth in transaction volumes through licensing of new systems, sale of capacity upgrades, and scalability of platform-based solutions. Banks, intermediaries, merchants, and billers are transitioning to cloud technology to leverage lower-cost computing technologies, increase time to market, accelerate innovation, and ensure scalability and resiliency. Market sizing data from Omdia indicates that spend on SAAS and PAAS payment systems is growing faster than installed applications.
