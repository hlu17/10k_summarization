Liquidity: As of September 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $209.5 million, a decrease of $162.9 million from $372.3 million as of September 30, 2020. Our working capital was $(324.8) million as of September 30, 2021, compared to $(256.5) million as of September 30, 2020. We had $298.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our international operations totaled $35.7 million as of September 30, 2021 and $60.9 million as of September 30, 2020. We expect the cash held overseas to be permanently invested in our international operations, and our U.S. operations to be funded through its own operating cash flows, cash and marketable securities within the U.S., and if necessary, borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We do not believe that post-closing working capital adjustments under the agreement, if any, will have a material impact on our results of operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 130% of the applicable conversion price per share for each of our convertible debentures for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending September 30, 2021. As a result, holders of our 1.25% 2025 debentures and 1.0% 2035 debentures have the right to convert all or any portion of their debentures between October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, we redeemed all of the outstanding 1.5% 2035 debentures on November 5, 2021. We believe that it is uneconomic, and thus unlikely, for the holders of the 1.25% 2025 debentures to early exercise their conversion rights. In the event that holders of any of our debentures presented an amount for settlement that exceeded our then available sources of liquidity, we may need to obtain additional financing. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $247.6 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from $254.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $42.4 million, a decrease of $115.2 million from $72.7 million for fiscal year 2020. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $322.7 million, a decrease of $263.5 million from $586.2 million for fiscal year 2020.

Debt: Contractual payment obligations of $38.0M as of Sept. 30, 2021, including $32.9M in expected cash interest payments in FY 2022; debt covenants in compliance; foreign currency forward contracts of $52.5M with no cash requirements until maturity; no requirements to pay selling stockholders based on performance targets; deferred compensation payments of $15.0M to former stockholders contingent upon continued employment; expected liabilities of $114.0M upon completion of merger with Microsoft.
