Revenues: The company had revenue of $21,007,076 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, a 5% increase from the previous year. The increase was driven by growth in subscription and marketplace revenue, partially offset by one-time license revenue in 2020. Marketplace revenue was boosted by the demand for PPE such as nitrile gloves, masks, freezers and telecommunication equipment due to COVID-19 disruptions. The principal customers for the company’s products are multi-store retail chains, wholesalers and distributors and their suppliers. Revenue is generated from subscription fees, transaction based fees, professional services fees, license fees and hosting and maintenance fees. Subscription revenue is based on a flat fee or volumetric metric. Marketplace revenue is transactional and sourced via the application. Professional services revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion or pro rata basis. License arrangements are time-specific and perpetual. Software maintenance agreements provide access to new software enhancements, maintenance releases, patches, updates and technical support personnel. Hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of software and customers’ data.

Gross Profit Margin: cost of services and product support was $6,884,647 or 33% of total revenue, and $ 6,997,424 or 35% of total revenue for the years ended june 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a 2 % decrease. this decrease is primarily the result of (i) higher expense associated to marketplace and the sales of ppe; and (ii) an increase in hardware/software non-capitalized items required for updating our information systems security, maintaining equipment licensing and other database systems. while we have experienced a significant increase in marketplace costs and corresponding revenue during the pandemic due to demand in ppe, it is unclear what level of ongoing marketplace costs we may experience as the pandemic begins to abate.

Operating Income: The company provides investors with adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP income per share, two non-GAAP financial measures, to supplement financial statements. These measures are used by management to compare performance to prior periods and for trend analyses and planning. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures and are subject to inherent limitations.

Liquidity: Net cash provided by operating activities increased 29% to $5,401,815 in the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $4,916,139 in the same period of 2020 due to higher revenues and lower operating costs. Noncash expense decreased by $695,456 in 2021 due to gain on debt extinguishment, increased depreciation and amortization, and lower stock compensation expense. Net cash used in financing activities decreased to $1,357,950 in 2021 compared to $1,809,810 in 2020 due to payoff of a financing arrangement with a bank and lower stock buyback program. Cash was $24,070,322 in 2021, an 18% increase from $20,345,330 in 2020, mainly due to higher software and marketplace revenue, collection of accounts receivable, and extinguished debt. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $318,873 in 2021 from $650,422 in 2020 due to lack of buildout of new headquarters and data center in 2021. Working capital increased to $20,400,991 in 2021 from $18,236,664 in 2020 due to higher cash resulting from higher revenue. Current assets increased to $29,701,774 in 2021 from $27,148,911 in 2020 due to increase in cash, decrease in contract assets and prepaid expense, and decrease in accounts receivable. Current liabilities increased to $9,300,783 in 2021 from $8,912,247 in 2020 due to increase in line of credit, decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable, and decrease in current portion of notes payable and extinguished debt. Management believes that the company will have adequate cash resources to fund operations and satisfy debt obligations for at least the next 12 months.
