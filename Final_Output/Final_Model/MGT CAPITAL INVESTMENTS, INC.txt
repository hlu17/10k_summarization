Business Overview: MGT consolidated its bitcoin mining operations in a company-owned and managed facility in Lafayette, GA in early 2019. The facility has access to over 20MW of low-cost power and the company owned 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro miners as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021 respectively. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects with the miners, leaving approximately half in need of repair or replacement. MGT is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations, including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newer generation miners. Previous hosting agreements were terminated in March 2019, August and September 2019 and December 2019.

Results of Operations: Revenues for 2020 increased by $990, or 220%, to $1,440 compared to $450 in 2019, mainly from cryptocurrency mining. Operating expenses decreased by $3,640, or 46%, to $4,311 in 2020. Cost of revenue increased by $1,218, or 239%, to $1,728 in 2020 due to higher electricity usage and depreciation. General and administrative expenses decreased by $4,857, or 65%, to $2,584 in 2020 due to lower stock-based compensation, payroll and related expenses, consulting fees, and legal and professional fees. Non-operating expense for 2020 consisted of accretion of debt discount of $882, a loss on sale of property and equipment of $352, and interest expense of $347, partially offset by the change in fair value of the liability associated with the termination of management agreements of $26, the change in fair value of derivative liability of $309, funding from PPP loan of $111, and other income of $119. For 2019, non-operating expense consisted of accretion of debt discount of $5,605, partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,540, interest income of $10, a gain on sale of property and equipment of $599, and a change in the fair value of the liability associated with the termination of the management agreements of $176.

Liquidity: The company has historically financed its business through the sale of debt and equity interests, and as of December 31, 2020 had an accumulated deficit of $418,389, cash and cash equivalents of $236, and a working capital deficit of $1,527. It had one note payable outstanding with a principal amount of $230. To grow its operations and pay current maturities of debt, the company will need to raise additional funds, though there is no assurance it will be able to do so. The company has taken steps to lower operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including salary reductions for senior management and termination of certain consulting agreements. Equity purchase agreements, sale of preferred stock, and sale of common stock have been used to raise funds. Debt financing includes a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $230, a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $13,210, and a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $111. Property and equipment acquisitions have been made in connection with consolidating activities in a company-owned and managed facility. The company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
