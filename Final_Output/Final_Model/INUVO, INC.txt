Results of Operations: Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower revenue from the ValidClick platform and renegotiation of payment terms and conditions. The IntentKey platform grew 22.2%. Cost of revenue decreased due to the decline in ValidClick revenue and decision to reduce certain outsourced campaign management tasks. Marketing costs decreased due to the decline in revenue, decision to reduce use of outside agencies, and renegotiating payment terms. Compensation expense was higher due to higher employee salary expense, commissions, stock-based compensation, and accrued incentive pay. Selling, general and administrative costs were lower due to $1 million in legal and professional fees related to the terminated merger in 2019. Interest expense, net, was lower due to decreased borrowings from financed receivables. Other income, net, of $997 thousand in 2020 was primarily due to the PPP loan being fully forgiven and $3.4 million in 2019 was due primarily to the termination fee and excess fair value over assets received for Retargeter.

Liquidity: The company's sources of liquidity include the sale of common stock, borrowings under its credit facility with Hitachi, and borrowings from non-bank financial institutions.
