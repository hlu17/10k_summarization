Our current ratio on April 30, 2021 was 2.7 to 1 and days sales outstanding (“DSO”) in accounts receivable were 85 days. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs during at least the next twelve months. Repurchase Plan: On August 19, 2002, our board of directors approved a resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock.
