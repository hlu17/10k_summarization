Revenues: Revenues decreased by 51.5% to $6.6 million in 2020 from $13.6 million in 2019 due to lower sales of the tracecop product line. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $3.8 million or 57.7% of net revenue in 2020, compared to $1.3 million or 9.5% of net revenue in 2019, mainly due to activities to build, train and prepare a sales department for a new commercial product and a dedicated $1.2 million marketing and promotion budget. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase if net revenue levels increase in 2021. Export sales were absent in 2020 and 2019 due to focus on domestic revenue sales, which may be subject to currency exchange risk. Monthly sales cycle causes a higher accounts receivable balance at month end and an inflated comparative relationship between revenue and accounts receivable. Monthly sales forecast and planning meetings are held in the first week of every month, the middle of the month is focused on sales calls to customers and the latter half of the month on closing sales.

Gross Profit Margin: gross profit decreased 52.9% to $3.9 million in 2020 from $8.3 million in 2019. as a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased from 60.8% in 2019 to 59.1% in 2020. gross profit as a percentage of revenue, decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 because of higher labor costs related to certain projects. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue is impacted by several factors, including shifts in product mix, changes in channels of distribution, sales volume, fluctuations in manufacturing costs, labor costs, pricing strategies, and fluctuations in sales of integrated third-party products.

Interest Expense: interest expense decreased to $6 thousand in 2020, compared to $46 thousand in 2019. interest expense decreased due to a combination of a zero balance under an unsecured revolving promissory note to borrow up to $3,700,000 from g. ward paxton, the company’s former chief executive officer (the “ceo note”) and declining balances in financial leases and remained steady for operating leases. interest expense will vary in the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs.

Liquidity: At December 31, 2020, the company had $16.7 million of cash and cash equivalents as its principal source of liquidity and working capital of $16.2 million. Net cash used in operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $5.2 million, with a net loss of $6.5 million and cash used for deferred revenue, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $320 thousand for purchases of property and equipment, and in 2019 was $260 thousand. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $18.9 million from a stock offering, PPP loan, and proceeds from exercise of stock options, and used for preferred stock dividends and payment on principal of finance right-of-use leases. Net cash used in financing activities in 2019 was $2.3 million primarily due to payments on the loan by an officer, payment of dividends on preferred stock, and payments on principal on financing leases. Future fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventory balances and accounts payable will depend on quarterly sales, timely collection of accounts receivable, and accuracy of forecasts of product demand and component requirements. The company expects to fund its operations through anticipated company profits and the $18 million in net proceeds from the secondary public offering, and may explore acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies. In order to finance such acquisitions and working capital, additional funds may be required through public or private financings.
