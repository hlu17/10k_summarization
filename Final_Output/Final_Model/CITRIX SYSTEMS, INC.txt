Business Overview: Citrix is an enterprise software company focused on helping organizations deliver a consistent and secure work experience no matter where work needs to get done. They offer app delivery and security solutions that can be consumed via hardware or software, as well as workspace solutions to give employees the resources and space they need to do their best work. In 2020, they saw strong demand for their workspace solutions and an acceleration of customers adopting their cloud offerings to manage their workspace environments. They discontinued broad availability of perpetual licenses for their workspace beginning in October 2020, and customers now have the option of acquiring new citrix workspace seats in the form of SaaS or on-premises subscription offerings. In 2021, they acquired Wrike, a leader in the SaaS collaborative work management space, for $2.25 billion in cash. They also declared a dividend of $0.37 per share and entered into a 2021 term loan credit agreement for $1.00 billion to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Wrike. They believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trends driving distributed teams and hybrid-work, emphasizing the importance of an organizationâ€™s ability to securely deliver all of the work resources employees need in one unified experience. For the year ended December 31, 2020, subscription revenue increased 71.3% to $1.11 billion, SaaS revenue increased 38.4% to $540.8 million, product and license revenue decreased 23.8% to $444.4 million, support and services revenue decreased 5.6% to $1.68 billion, and operating income increased 13.6% to $608.8 million. Subscription and SaaS ARR increased due to an increase in subscription sales. They provided $1,000 per employee to cover expenses related to transitioning to a work from home environment due to the pandemic, and they expect total revenue to increase when comparing the 2021 fiscal year to the 2020 fiscal year.

Results of Operations: Subscription revenue increased due to on-premise license demand and customer cloud adoption of solutions delivered via the cloud. However, product and license revenue decreased, primarily due to a decrease in sales of perpetual app delivery and security products and workspace solutions. Support and services revenue also decreased due to the revenue being reported in the subscription revenue line. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase from subscription, mostly from cloud-based subscription offerings and on-premise subscription license updates and maintenance. Cost of subscription, support, and services revenue increased, and cost of product and license revenue decreased. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained consistent in 2020 compared to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates impacted the operating expenses, which increased in research and development expenses, sales, marketing, and services expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Restructuring expenses decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to a net decrease in employee severance and related costs.

Liquidity: Liquidity: In 2020, we generated operating cash flows of $935.8 million, primarily from net income of $504.4 million and non-cash charges of $307.7 million and $207.9 million. Our investing activities used $138.3 million of cash, mainly for net purchases of investments of $88.3 million and cash paid for the purchase of property and equipment of $41.4 million. Our financing activities used cash of $595.2 million, primarily for stock repurchases of $1.29 billion, cash dividends paid on common stock of $172.0 million and cash paid for tax withholding on vested stock awards of $121.7 million. We entered into a $1.00 billion term loan credit agreement, issued $750.0 million of unsecured senior notes due March 1, 2030 and entered into a $250.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We also entered into a bridge facility and take-out facility commitment letter and a 2021 term loan credit agreement. We believe our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements and service our debt obligations for the next 12 months.

Debt: Our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 include: (1) $48 million due under our 2027 notes, 2030 notes, and term loan credit agreement; (2) $8.8 million for non-cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year-end 2021 and a contingent obligation to purchase inventory of approximately $19.9 million; (3) $950 million for our use of certain cloud services with one third-party provider, of which $19.3 million is due in less than one year; (4) $74.7 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions; and (5) no individual material finance lease obligations or other material long-term commitments. We do not have any special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
