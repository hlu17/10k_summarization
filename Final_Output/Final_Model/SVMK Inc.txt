Business Overview: SurveyMonkey is a leader in agile software solutions that help companies turn stakeholder feedback into action. Their platform enables users to collect, analyze and act on feedback from customers, employees, website and app users, and market research audiences. SurveyMonkey offers SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillarsâ€”Surveys, Customer Experience and Market Research. They operate as a single operating segment and have a broad and diverse customer base. Their survey platform is inherently viral, allowing existing users to introduce potential new users and customers to their products. SurveyMonkey is executing a two-part growth strategy to capitalize on the virality of their platform and the scale of business use cases in their user base. This includes delivering new features and product tiers, investing in product innovation, and increasing sales and cross-selling of their SaaS offerings into small, midsize, and large enterprises. As of December 31, 2020, they had over 20 million active users, of which approximately 820,300 were paying users. Over 90% of their trailing 12-month bookings were from organizational domain-based customers and their organizational dollar-based net retention rate was over 100%. They generate substantially all of their revenue from the sale of subscriptions to their products.

Revenues: Revenues: Majority of our revenue comes from sales of subscriptions to our software products for survey feedback and customer experience. Small portion of revenue generated from sales of subscriptions to our transactional market research solutions. Recognize subscription revenue over subscription term, usually 1 month to 1 year. Non-cancellable contracts with no refund provisions. Collect payment primarily from credit cards at start of subscription period. ARPU: Revenue divided by average number of paying users during period. Calculated by adding number of paying users as of end of prior period to number of paying users as of end of current period, then dividing by two. Used to illustrate underlying trends in business & our ability to upsell/cross-sell products/solutions. Limitations of ARPU include not reflecting expenses to generate revenue.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin: Revenue increased due to increases in the number of paying users and ARPU, driven primarily by enterprise sales channel. Revenue growth was also driven by demand arising from use cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the incremental revenue contributions from acquisitions. Gross margins increased primarily due to the increase in revenue.

Operating Income: we review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our business plan and make strategic decisions. we believe that, in addition to our results determined in accordance with gaap, free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition.
