Business Overview: We are a leader in providing cloud email security, productivity, and compliance solutions. In 2020, we reported record revenue of $218.5 million, an increase of 26% compared to the prior year, driven by recognition of twelve full months of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to our AppRiver business and steady customer additions. Our 2020 operating profit of $4.6 million increased $13.7 million over the prior year, and our $6.4 million net loss in 2020 is an improvement of $8.2 million compared to the prior year. Our backlog was $83.4 million at December 31, 2020. 35% of our 2020 revenue was attributable to the healthcare sector, 25% to finance, and 20% to government.

Results of Operations: We attempt to grow our business by signing new customers and selling new or higher volume services to existing customers while retaining existing customers through renewal of their subscriptions. Our services are sold on a subscription basis with contract terms historically ranging from one to five years billed annually, but increasingly moving toward a monthly billing model. We recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription once service commences. As of December 31, 2020, our net dollar customer retention was 100%, and our Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $237.7 million. Our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services.

Revenues: Revenues increased by 26% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the AppRiver acquisition in February 2019 which contributed $97.8 million in 2019. Revenue was categorized into 21% Healthcare, 17% Financial Services, 3% Government Sector and 59% Other in 2020, and 23% Healthcare, 19% Financial Services, 4% Government Sector and 54% Other in 2019. 76% and 74% of new business in 2020 and 2019 respectively were from partner relationships. ARR grew by 28% in 2020 compared to 2019. The company expects continued growth in 2021.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross Profit Margin: The cost of revenue increased $35.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the resale of Microsoft Office365 and hosted exchange products. The cost of revenue increased $61.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the acquisition of Appriver in February 2019. Selling and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to increases in commissions and headcount expense and the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The selling and marketing expenses increased $34.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the Appriver acquisition and related integration activities.

Liquidity: Our primary source of liquidity from operations was collection of revenue in advance from customers, accounts receivable and management of timing of payments to vendors and service providers. In 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $21.4 million, an increase of $8.1 million from 2019. Cash flow from operations in 2020 was $31.3 million, an increase of $17.3 million from 2019. We achieved 26% growth in revenue, 48% gross margin and strong cash collections in 2020. In 2021, we expect cash provided by operations to improve and plan to monitor our position to protect our company against uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and availability under our $25 million revolving facility will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months. We also have the ability to adjust overall cash spending and raise additional funds if needed.

Debt: The company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, providing for a $175 million senior secured term loan, a $10 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility, and a $25 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The company used the proceeds of the credit facilities to pay for the Appriver and Deliveryslip acquisitions, as well as to fund the acquisition of Cloudally, and to repay all existing borrowing under the revolving facility. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of the company and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and guaranteed by substantially all of the companyâ€™s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the company had severance agreements with certain employees which would require up to $5.3 million in payments in the event of a triggering event such as a change of control.
