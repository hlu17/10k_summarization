Business Overview: Rocketfuel Blockchain, Inc. is a company providing check-out and payment systems that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. Their check-out systems are designed to enhance customersâ€™ data protection and increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants. They offer a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments, a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect to various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks, and a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page. They also plan to add connectivity to binance, kraken, gemini and other exchanges to pay directly from bank accounts and from any cryptocurrency wallet. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences and is integrated with popular ecommerce platforms and browsers. They utilize a variety of blockchains in their execution including bitcoin, ethereum and others where the payment transactions are stored. They believe their system is significantly less expensive than the cost of credit-card transactions and provide a streamlined one- to-three-click check-out process for ecommerce purchases.
