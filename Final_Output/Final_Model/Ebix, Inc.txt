Revenues: sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.7 million, or 29%, from $19.6 million in 2019 to $13.8 million in 2020. this decrease is primarily due to reduced advertising and marketing costs in response to covid-19. 

Operating Income: The company generated $100.4 million of net cash flow from operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $39.6 million, or 65%. The increase was primarily due to increased cash flow from reductions in accounts receivable from trade and service providers as Covid-19 reduced revenues and resulted in comparatively more accounts receivable conversion to cash in 2020 versus 2019. Additionally, in 2019 the acquisition earn-out accrual was reduced by $16.5 million compared to a reduction of the same accrual in 2020 of $3.1 million, both of which served to reduce operating cash flow given the non-cash nature of the gains from earn-out adjustments. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company's total revenue increased $45.0 million, or 8%, to $625.6 million compared to $580.6 million in 2019. This was due to strong demand for the company's payment solutions offerings in India (primarily prepaid gift cards), which increased by more than $200 million year-over-year to approximately $256 million, or 590% year-over-year growth. This was offset by a year-over-year decline in revenues in 2020 in excess of $150 million, an approximately 65% decline year-over-year, in the company's travel, foreign exchange, remittance and e-learning businesses.

Liquidity: Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents on hand. We intend to use these sources, along with potential debt or equity issuance, to fund capital expenditures, organic growth initiatives, strategic business acquisitions, retiring of outstanding indebtedness, and repurchasing shares of our common stock. We believe our anticipated cash flows, current cash balances, and access to credit and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months. In the event of additional liquidity needs, we may raise funds from potential debt or equity securities, though there are no assurances that such financing will be available. Our current ratio increased from 1.55 to 1.89, and our working capital position increased to $170.5 million at December 31, 2020. Net cash used for financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $42.0 million, mainly from a decrease in our working capital facilities in India, payments against our credit facility term loan, and dividends to holders of our common stock. Net cash used for investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $44.8 million, mainly related to a decrease in marketable securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and software development.
